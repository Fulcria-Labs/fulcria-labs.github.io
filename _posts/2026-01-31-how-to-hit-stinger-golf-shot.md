Few shots in golf are as iconic—or as intimidating—as the stinger. Popularized by Tiger Woods, this low, boring trajectory cuts through wind and rolls out for extra distance. It's part utility shot, part statement.

**The good news:** The stinger isn't as difficult as it looks. With the right adjustments to your setup and swing, you can add this powerful weapon to your arsenal.

## What Is a Stinger?

A stinger is a low, controlled shot with a penetrating trajectory that typically stays below tree height, cuts through wind, and produces significant roll after landing.

**Key characteristics:**
- Ball flight peaks at 15-30 feet (versus 80+ feet for a normal iron)
- Strong, boring trajectory with minimal spin
- Runs out 20-50 yards after landing
- Total distance often exceeds a normal shot despite lower trajectory

**It differs from a punch shot** in that a stinger is a full power shot with controlled height, while a punch is typically a recovery shot with reduced speed.

## When to Hit a Stinger

### Perfect Conditions for a Stinger

**Strong headwinds:** A normal high shot balloons and loses distance. A stinger cuts through, maintaining distance.

**Crosswinds:** Lower trajectory means less time for wind to push the ball offline.

**Firm fairways:** The stinger's roll maximizes distance on hard, running conditions.

**Links-style courses:** Where running the ball is part of the game plan.

**Tight fairways needing control:** The stinger's lower spin means less curvature.

**Under trees:** When you need maximum distance while staying below obstacles.

### When NOT to Hit a Stinger

- Soft, receptive greens that need stopping power
- Elevated greens where you need to carry bunkers
- When you have a tailwind (high shots maximize downwind advantage)
- Short approach shots where precision matters more than distance

## The Setup for a Stinger

### Ball Position
Move the ball back in your stance—**2-3 inches behind center** for most stingers. This promotes:
- A more descending strike
- Reduced dynamic loft at impact
- Forward shaft lean naturally

### Stance
**Slightly narrower than normal.** This:
- Promotes a more vertical swing plane
- Limits lower body motion (which can add loft)
- Creates stability for the punch-like motion

### Weight Distribution
Start with **60% of your weight on your front foot.** This:
- Pre-sets the forward impact position
- Encourages ball-first contact
- Reduces any tendency to scoop

### Grip
Move your hands slightly down the shaft—**about 1-2 inches.** This:
- Gives you more control
- Naturally de-lofts the club
- Shortens the swing arc

### Club Selection
Choose **1-2 clubs more than you'd normally use for the distance.**

Example: If it's a 150-yard shot and you'd normally hit 8-iron:
- For a stinger, grab a 6-iron or 5-iron
- The reduced loft will be compensated by the lower trajectory

**Best clubs for stingers:**
- 2-iron to 5-iron (long irons work best)
- Driving iron or utility iron (ideal)
- Low-lofted hybrid (if you're comfortable)

The higher-lofted clubs (7+) are harder to flight low because of their natural loft.

## The Stinger Swing

### Backswing Adjustments

**Three-quarter length:** Stop your backswing when your hands reach about shoulder height. This:
- Reduces power (replaced by roll-out)
- Promotes control and consistency
- Makes it easier to stay balanced

**Keep it connected:** The arms stay close to the body. No overswing, no wristiness.

**Limit hip turn:** About 35-40 degrees instead of a full 45-50. This quieter lower body keeps the swing compact.

### Downswing Keys

**Drive with the body, not the hands:** The stinger requires body rotation through impact, not a handsy release.

**Maintain the shaft lean:** This is critical. Feel like your hands are racing the clubhead to the ball—and winning.

**Stay down through impact:** Keep your chest over the ball longer than a normal swing. Don't stand up or back away.

**Compress hard:** Hit DOWN on the ball aggressively. The turf interaction should feel solid, almost punchy.

### The Abbreviated Follow-Through

This is the signature move of the stinger:

**Finish low and left** (for right-handed golfers). The club should finish at about shoulder height or below, with the shaft pointing left of the target.

**Why the short finish?**
- It limits wrist release, keeping loft low
- It indicates you maintained shaft lean through impact
- It's a natural result of the compact swing

**Key feel:** Imagine you're trying to hold the face looking at the ground past impact—like you're covering the ball with the clubface.

## The 4 Critical Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Ball Position Back
Without this, you'll hit a normal-height shot. Check your ball position is genuinely back of center.

### Checkpoint 2: Handle Forward at Impact
Your hands should be visibly ahead of the clubhead—more than a normal iron shot. Film yourself to verify.

### Checkpoint 3: Body Through, Not Around
The stinger requires your chest and hips to rotate through—you can't spin around your spine. Feel like you're hitting toward the target, not around yourself.

### Checkpoint 4: Low Finish
If you're finishing high, you're releasing the club normally. The stinger finish is low and controlled.

## Common Stinger Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Lifting at Impact
**Symptom:** Ball launches higher than intended.
**Cause:** Standing up through impact, adding loft.
**Fix:** Feel like you're hitting into a low ceiling. Keep your sternum moving down toward the ball through impact.

### Mistake 2: Early Release
**Symptom:** Ball flights normally despite setup changes.
**Cause:** Releasing the wrists before impact adds loft.
**Fix:** Feel like you're dragging the clubhead behind your hands. The wrists don't fully release until well past the ball.

### Mistake 3: Ball Too Far Back
**Symptom:** Heavy contact, balls going right, low trajectory but no distance.
**Cause:** Ball too far back creates a steep, out-to-in path.
**Fix:** Start with ball just 1-2 inches behind center. More back than that requires advanced technique.

### Mistake 4: Full Follow-Through
**Symptom:** Normal shot shape despite other changes.
**Cause:** A full finish means a full release.
**Fix:** Think "punch through" not "swing through." The finish should feel incomplete.

### Mistake 5: All Arms
**Symptom:** Thin contact, inconsistent flights.
**Cause:** Trying to manufacture the low shot with arm manipulation.
**Fix:** The stinger is a body-driven shot. Rotate through with your core, not your hands.

## Drills to Develop Your Stinger

### Drill 1: Headcover Gate
**Setup:** Place a headcover 6 inches in front of the ball on the target line, about 8 inches off the ground.

**Execution:** Hit shots that fly under the headcover.

**Why it works:** Forces you to genuinely flight the ball low, not just think about it.

### Drill 2: The Shaft-Across-Chest Finish
**Setup:** Normal stinger setup.

**Execution:** Focus on finishing with the shaft horizontal across your chest, pointing left of target.

**Why it works:** Grooves the abbreviated finish that indicates maintained shaft lean.

### Drill 3: The Hold-Off Release
**Setup:** Use a 5 or 6 iron.

**Execution:** Hit balls where you intentionally "hold off" the release—feel like you're blocking the face from closing.

**Why it works:** Develops the feel of keeping loft off through impact.

### Drill 4: Alignment Stick Under Arm
**Setup:** Tuck an alignment stick under both armpits during the swing.

**Execution:** Make stinger swings keeping the stick in place through impact.

**Why it works:** Ensures body rotation drives the swing, not arm manipulation.

### Drill 5: The 50% Swing
**Setup:** Start with half-speed swings.

**Execution:** Hit stingers at 50% effort, focusing purely on technique.

**Why it works:** Speed often destroys stinger technique. Master it slow before adding power.

## Advanced Stinger Techniques

### The Wind Cheater
When facing a severe headwind:
- Use even more club (3-4 extra)
- Ball position further back
- Even shorter backswing
- Aggressive body rotation through
- Finish extra low

This creates a bullet that barely rises, maximizing penetration.

### The Running Approach
For links-style bump-and-run from 50+ yards:
- Use a 5 or 6 iron
- Ball far back
- Putting-style stroke with some body rotation
- Land the ball short and let it release to the hole

### The Tee Shot Stinger
Tiger's signature:
- Tee the ball low (just barely above the turf)
- Use a 2-iron or driving iron
- Normal stinger technique
- Aim for maximum roll on firm fairways

This sacrifices some carry for massive control and runout.

## Equipment for Better Stingers

### The Right Club
**Driving irons and utility irons** are purpose-built for stingers:
- Lower center of gravity than player's irons
- Designed for penetrating trajectory
- More forgiving than traditional long irons

Popular options: Titleist U-500, TaylorMade P790 UDI, Callaway X Forged UT.

### Shaft Considerations
A slightly stiffer shaft helps stinger consistency because:
- Less deflection at impact
- More predictable launch
- Better feel of shaft position

### Ball Selection
For optimal stinger performance:
- Lower-spinning balls reduce ballooning
- Firmer balls compress for penetrating flight
- Tour-level balls typically work well

## Video Analysis for Stinger Improvement

Technology can help perfect your stinger technique:

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Launch angle:** Should be 8-15 degrees (versus 15-25 for normal irons)
- **Spin rate:** Should be 30-50% lower than normal
- **Peak height:** Should be significantly reduced
- **Carry vs. total distance:** Stingers should have higher roll percentage

### What to Film
Record yourself from down-the-line to check:
- Shaft lean at impact
- Follow-through position
- Ball flight height

## When the Pros Use Stingers

### Tiger Woods
Tiger's 2-iron stinger at Royal Liverpool (2006 British Open) is legendary. He hit stinger after stinger off the tee, avoiding bunkers and controlling distance on the firm links.

### Dustin Johnson
DJ uses a stinger with his driving iron when he needs to find fairways. His version is more powerful, benefiting from his incredible speed.

### Rickie Fowler
Fowler's stinger with his utility iron is a key weapon on windy days, keeping the ball under the wind while maintaining distance.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Setup changes are critical:** Ball back, weight forward, grip down, hands ahead
2. **It's a body-driven shot:** Rotation, not hands, creates the low flight
3. **Short finish is essential:** The abbreviated follow-through indicates maintained loft control
4. **Choose the right club:** Long irons and driving irons work best
5. **Use it situationally:** Wind, firm conditions, and under trees are ideal
6. **Practice the abbreviated swing:** The three-quarter backswing and low finish take repetition
7. **Start slow:** Master technique before adding power

**The bottom line:** The stinger is an attainable shot for any golfer willing to practice the fundamentals. It's not magic—it's mechanics. Master the setup, trust the body rotation, and commit to the low finish. You'll soon have a shot that handles wind, finds fairways, and looks incredible doing it.
