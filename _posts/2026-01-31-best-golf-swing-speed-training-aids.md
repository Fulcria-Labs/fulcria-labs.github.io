## Quick Comparison: Top Speed Training Aids

## Understanding Overspeed Training

Overspeed training works by getting your body moving faster than normal using lighter clubs. This "tricks" your neuromuscular system into producing more speed, which then transfers to your driver.

**The science is simple:**
- Swing lighter clubs → brain learns faster movement patterns
- Swing heavier clubs → build golf-specific strength
- Alternate between both → maximize speed gains

For every 1 MPH of added clubhead speed, you gain approximately 3 yards of distance. A typical speed training program can add 5-8 MPH of swing speed over 6-8 weeks.

## Speed Training Tips for Maximum Results

### Consistency Is Key
Speed training only works with consistency. Commit to 3 sessions per week for at least 6 weeks before evaluating results.

### Don't Skip the Protocol
Each system has specific protocols for a reason. Don't just swing the clubs randomly—follow the prescribed workouts.

### Track Your Progress
Whether using an app, launch monitor, or radar device, track your speeds. Seeing progress keeps you motivated.

### Time Your Training
Do speed training:
- **Before practice:** When muscles are fresh
- **Not before rounds:** Can disrupt tempo for that day
- **At least 4 hours before playing:** If you must train on game day

### Combine With Mobility Work
Speed potential is limited by physical mobility. Add hip and thoracic spine stretches to your routine for better results.
