The ball comes off the face perfectly. Solid contact, good trajectory. But it sails left of the target and keeps going left. No curve, no spin, just a straight miss into the left rough or bunker.

That is a pull shot, and it is maddening because it often feels like you made a good swing. You did not top it, chunk it, or slice it. You just missed left. Again.

The reality is that a pull shot means something specific went wrong in your swing mechanics. Once you understand the cause, fixing it becomes straightforward.

## What Is a Pull Shot in Golf?

A pull is a shot that starts left of your target and travels in a straight line without curving. For left-handed golfers, it goes right. The defining characteristic is no sidespin. The ball flies straight, just in the wrong direction.

This differs from other common misses:

- **Hook**: Starts right or straight, curves hard left (closed face, inside-out path)
- **Pull hook**: Starts left, curves further left (closed face, outside-in path)
- **Slice**: Starts left, curves right (open face, outside-in path)
- **Pull**: Starts left, stays straight (face square to path, but path too far left)

Understanding this distinction matters because each miss has different root causes.

## What Causes a Pull Shot?

A pull happens when your clubface is square to your swing path, but your swing path is aimed left of the target. The face and path match perfectly, they are just both pointing the wrong direction.

Here is the ball flight physics: if your swing path is 8 degrees left and your clubface is also 8 degrees left, the ball starts left and flies straight. No curve because face equals path.

This is actually encouraging in one way. You have coordinated your face and path, which many golfers cannot do. You just need to redirect both toward the target.

### The 5 Main Causes of Pull Shots

#### 1. Outside-In Swing Path

The most common cause. An outside-in path means the club approaches the ball from outside the target line and exits inside it. You are essentially swinging across the ball to the left.

This often develops from trying to hit the ball hard with the upper body or casting the club from the top of the backswing. The over-the-top move pulls the club across your body.

**How to check**: Look at your divot pattern with irons. If divots point left of your target, your path is outside-in. Video analysis from behind shows the club exiting left of the ball.

#### 2. Alignment Issues

More often than you might think, a pulled shot is not a swing fault at all. It is an alignment fault. You are swinging exactly where your body is aimed, but your body is aimed left.

Many golfers who pull the ball are making decent swings in the direction their shoulders are pointing. The problem is their shoulders are pointing left.

**How to check**: Set up to a shot and have someone lay a club along your toe line without you moving. Step back and look. If that club points left of your target instead of parallel to the target line, your alignment is the issue. Our [alignment guide](/blog/golf-alignment-aim/) covers proper setup.

#### 3. Strong Grip

A grip where both hands are rotated too far clockwise (for right-handed golfers) promotes a closed clubface and active release. This makes it easier to close the face through impact, which can cause pulls even with a neutral path.

**How to check**: Look down at your lead hand at address. If you see four knuckles, your grip is very strong. Try rotating both hands counter-clockwise until you see only two to three knuckles.

#### 4. Ball Position Too Far Forward

When the ball is positioned too far toward your lead foot, you contact it after your swing has already started traveling left. At this point in the arc, the club is moving back inside and the face has started to close.

**How to check**: For mid-irons, the ball should be roughly center or slightly forward of center, not several inches inside your lead foot. Check our [ball position guide](/blog/golf-ball-position-guide/) for proper placement by club.

#### 5. Early Upper Body Rotation

When your shoulders spin open too early in the downswing, your arms and club follow. This throws the club outward and creates an outside-in path.

Often called coming over the top, this happens when the upper body dominates the downswing instead of the lower body leading. The instinct to hit hard with your arms causes the shoulders to fire first.

**How to check**: At impact, where are your shoulders pointing? They should be roughly parallel to the target line. If they are open (pointing left of target) at impact, you are spinning out early. Understanding the [downswing sequence](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/) helps fix this.

## How to Fix a Pull Shot

Start with the simple fixes before making swing changes. Many pulls can be corrected with setup adjustments alone.

### Fix 1: Check and Correct Your Alignment

This is the most important step. Lay alignment sticks on the ground during practice, one along your toe line and one along your target line. Your feet should be parallel to your target, not pointing at it.

Also check your shoulders. Many golfers align their feet correctly but let their shoulders open up. At address, your shoulders should be parallel to your foot line.

Use an intermediate target. Pick a spot on the ground a few feet in front of the ball on your target line. Aim your clubface at that spot first, then build your stance around the clubface.

### Fix 2: Neutralize Your Grip

If your grip is too strong, weaken it slightly. Rotate both hands counter-clockwise on the club until you see two to three knuckles on your lead hand at address.

A neutral grip helps the clubface return to square naturally without requiring you to manipulate it. See our [grip guide](/blog/golf-grip-guide/) for detailed hand positions.

### Fix 3: Adjust Ball Position

If the ball is too far forward, move it back slightly toward the center of your stance. For mid-irons, center position works well. For short irons, even slightly back of center.

Moving the ball back means you contact it earlier in your swing arc, before the club starts traveling back inside. This alone can straighten out pulls.

### Fix 4: Lead with Your Lower Body

The over-the-top move that causes pulls often stems from using the upper body to start the downswing. The fix is learning to initiate the downswing with your lower body.

Feel like your hips start rotating toward the target while your shoulders stay back. This drops the club into the slot and promotes an inside-out path rather than outside-in.

A useful thought is weight shift before rotation. Feel your weight move to your lead foot, then let your hips turn. This sequence prevents the shoulders from firing first.

### Fix 5: Keep Your Right Knee Flexed

Some golfers lock their lead knee at impact, which changes hip angle and promotes an outside-in path. Maintain slight flex in both knees throughout the swing.

If you are locking your lead knee and pulling shots, consciously keep that knee soft through impact. This allows your hips to rotate fully without changing your posture.

## 5 Drills to Stop Pulling Golf Shots

### Drill 1: Headcover Behind Ball

This drill prevents the over-the-top move.

**Setup**: Place a headcover about 10 inches behind the ball and 3 inches above ball height (propped on a tee box or small object).

**Execution**: Make swings without hitting the headcover. Golfers who pull come over the top and drag across the ball, which would hit the headcover.

**Goal**: Feel the club dropping under and behind, approaching from inside. Start with half swings.

### Drill 2: Feet Together Drill

This drill stops overactive arm action.

**Setup**: Hit balls with your feet touching, no wider than a few inches apart.

**Execution**: Make smooth swings. Without a wide base, you cannot spin your upper body aggressively.

**Goal**: Feel how a quiet lower body and smooth arm swing produces straighter shots. Gradually widen your stance while keeping the same tempo.

### Drill 3: Step Drill

This drill trains proper weight shift and sequencing.

**Setup**: Start with your feet together at address.

**Execution**: Take the club back, then step your lead foot toward the target as you start the downswing. Swing through and hit the ball.

**Goal**: The step forces you to start with your lower body. It is impossible to come over the top when your lead foot is moving first.

### Drill 4: Trail Arm Behind Back

This drill stops shoulder spin.

**Setup**: Take your stance with your trail arm behind your back, gripping just above your hip.

**Execution**: Make slow motion swings feeling your lead arm control the club while your shoulders stay back.

**Goal**: Feel how the arms can swing down without the shoulders spinning open. Add the trail arm back gradually.

### Drill 5: Two Turns Drill

This drill promotes body rotation over arm swing.

**Setup**: Take your normal stance with a mid-iron.

**Execution**: Think of the swing as just two turns. Turn back, turn through. No hitting, no swiping, just turning.

**Goal**: When you think turn instead of hit, your bigger muscles drive the swing and the path straightens out. The desire to hit creates the over-the-top lunge.

## Pull Shot vs Pull Hook: What Is the Difference?

A pull and a pull hook start the same way but behave differently after launch.

**Pull**: Ball starts left, flies straight left. Face is square to path, both aiming left.

**Pull hook**: Ball starts left, curves further left. Face is closed to path, path is outside-in.

If your ball curves after starting left, you have a face issue on top of a path issue. The closed face creates hook spin. You need to address both the path and the grip that closes your face.

If your ball flies straight but left, focus on path and alignment. Your face-to-path relationship is good, just misdirected.

## Common Mistakes When Fixing Pull Shots

### Aiming Right to Compensate

The worst fix is aiming right and playing the pull. This grooves bad mechanics and fails under pressure when your path might change. Fix the cause instead of managing the symptom.

### Overemphasis on Inside-Out

Some instruction advises swinging dramatically inside-out to fix pulls. This can overcorrect into pushes and push slices. You want a neutral path, not the opposite extreme.

### Ignoring Alignment

Many golfers skip alignment checks because they trust their aim. Do not. Use alignment sticks every practice session until proper aim is automatic. Most golfers aim left of target without realizing it.

### Changing Too Many Variables

Pick one fix and practice it for a full session before adding another. If you change grip, ball position, and swing path simultaneously, you cannot know what is working.

## Using Video to Diagnose Your Pull

Video analysis reveals what you cannot feel.

**Face-on view**: Check ball position relative to your stance. Watch if your shoulders open early. See if your weight stays back instead of shifting forward.

**Down-the-line view**: Watch your club path at impact. Does the club approach from outside and exit inside? That is your pull pattern visualized.

**Slow motion**: Freeze at impact. Where are your shoulders pointing? Where is the club traveling? Compare to a pro swing with good path.

Recording your swing takes thirty seconds and saves hours of guessing. For setup tips, see our guide on [recording your golf swing](/blog/phone-golf-swing-video/).

AI swing analysis can automatically detect path direction and alert you to over-the-top patterns. This shortens your diagnosis time from weeks of experimentation to minutes.

## Quick Reference: Pull Shot Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | First Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Pull with every club | Alignment issue | Check aim with sticks |
| Pull with irons only | Ball too far forward | Move ball back one width |
| Pull with driver | Over-the-top path | Headcover drill |
| Pull that turns to hook | Strong grip plus path | Weaken grip first |
| Pull when trying to hit hard | Upper body dominant | Two turns drill |
| Pull late in round | Fatigue causing spin-out | Feet together drill |

## The Bottom Line

A pull shot means your clubface and path are matched, they are just both aimed left. This is better than a slice or hook because you have already learned face-to-path coordination.

Start with alignment. Most pulls are actually alignment issues disguised as swing problems. Use alignment sticks religiously until you trust your setup.

If alignment is correct, work on sequencing. Learn to start the downswing with your lower body instead of spinning your shoulders. The drills above train this feeling.

Video analysis accelerates the process. What feels like swinging right might actually be swinging straight. Recording removes guesswork and lets you target the real issue.

Pull shots are fixable. With proper diagnosis and focused practice, that straight miss left becomes a straight hit down the middle.
