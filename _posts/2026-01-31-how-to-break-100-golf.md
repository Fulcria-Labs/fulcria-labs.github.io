Breaking 100 feels like climbing Everest when you are stuck at 105 or 110. But here is something that might surprise you: **you do not need a single par to break 100.**

Do the math. If you shoot 9 bogeys and 9 double bogeys, that is 99. No pars. No birdies. Just consistent, disaster-free golf.

The path to breaking 100 is not about hitting more greens or adding 30 yards to your drive. It is about eliminating the blow-up holes that wreck your scorecard. That triple on hole 5. The quadruple on 12. The snowman on 17.

Here are seven strategies that will get you under 100, probably faster than you think.

## 1. Make "Bogey Golf" Your Goal

Stop trying to make pars. Seriously.

When you aim for par on every hole, you take risks that do not match your skill level. You go for the green from 200 yards out. You aim at the pin tucked behind the bunker. You try to carry the water instead of laying up.

**The bogey mindset changes everything.** If your target is bogey:

- A 400-yard par 4 becomes three manageable shots (150 + 150 + 100) plus two putts
- A 500-yard par 5 becomes four easy shots plus two putts
- A 160-yard par 3 becomes a safe shot to the fat part of the green plus two putts

Planning for bogey removes pressure. It gives you margin for error. And ironically, when you stop pressing for pars, some of them start showing up anyway.

## 2. Avoid the Big Numbers

Here is the most important rule for breaking 100: **no hole should cost you more than double bogey.**

One quadruple bogey wipes out three good holes. A triple bogey erases two. These big numbers are scorecard killers, and they almost always come from the same source: compounding mistakes.

The pattern looks like this:

1. Bad tee shot into trouble
2. Risky recovery attempt that stays in trouble (or creates new trouble)
3. Frustration leads to rushed third shot
4. Suddenly you are looking at a 7 or 8

The fix is simple in theory, hard in practice: **take your medicine.** When you are in the trees, punch out sideways. When you are in a terrible lie, advance the ball to a good position. When the hero shot has a 20% chance of working, it also has an 80% chance of making things worse.

For a complete guide to making smarter decisions on the course, check out our [course management strategy guide](/blog/golf-course-management-strategy/).

### The Pocket Rule

Before attempting any recovery shot, ask yourself: "What is the worst that could happen?"

If the answer involves water, out of bounds, or another unplayable lie, choose a different shot. A bogey from a conservative play beats a triple from a failed miracle attempt every time.

## 3. Tee It Forward

Ego is expensive in golf. Playing from tees that are too long adds strokes you cannot afford.

Here is a guideline: if your driver carry distance is under 200 yards, play from the forward tees. This is not about being "good enough" for certain tees. It is about setting up approach shots you can actually execute.

From the tips, a 380-yard hole leaves you 180 yards out after a 200-yard drive. That is a club most high-handicappers cannot hit consistently. From the forward tees at 320 yards, you are looking at 120 yards. That is a comfortable 9-iron or pitching wedge.

**The math matters:**
- Shorter approach shots = more greens hit
- More greens hit = fewer chips and pitch shots
- Fewer short game shots = fewer opportunities for disaster

Play tees that match your game, not your ego.

## 4. Leave the Driver in the Bag (Sometimes)

Your driver is probably your least accurate club. For most golfers trying to break 100, it is also the source of their biggest troubles.

Consider this: on a 350-yard par 4, two 175-yard shots with a hybrid get you to the green. A 220-yard drive only leaves 130 yards, but if that drive goes into the trees, water, or out of bounds, you have just doubled your work.

**When to hit driver:**
- Wide fairways with no serious trouble
- Holes where you need the distance to have a reasonable approach
- When you are striking it well that day

**When to hit 3-wood, hybrid, or long iron instead:**
- Tight holes with water or OB close to the fairway
- Doglegs where driver might run through the corner
- When your driver is not cooperating that round

As top instructor John Hughes advises: "At the 100-shooter level, it is not about how far you can hit it. The truth is you are not keeping it in play."

Hitting a 180-yard hybrid to the fairway beats a 240-yard driver into the woods every time.

## 5. Focus 70% of Your Practice on Short Game

If you want to drop strokes fast, the answer is not on the driving range. It is on the practice green and the chipping area.

**Why short game matters so much for breaking 100:**

Most golfers shooting over 100 are not hitting many greens in regulation. That means nearly every hole involves a chip or pitch shot. If those shots consistently leave you 15-20 feet from the hole instead of 5-6 feet, you are adding strokes all day long.

Additionally, three-putts are score killers. Every three-putt costs you a stroke you cannot get back. If you three-putt six times per round, that alone is the difference between 102 and 96.

### Short Game Practice Priorities

**Putting first.** Work on distance control from 20-30 feet. The goal is not making long putts. It is eliminating three-putts. If you can consistently lag the ball within 3 feet, your scores will drop immediately. Our [putting fundamentals guide](/blog/putting-fundamentals/) covers the essential drills.

**Basic chipping second.** You need one reliable chip shot that gets the ball on the green and rolling toward the hole. Nothing fancy. Just consistent contact that advances the ball. See our guide on [chipping made simple](/blog/chipping-made-simple/) for the technique.

**Pitch shots third.** Once your chips are solid, work on 30-50 yard pitch shots. These are the most common approach distances for players shooting around 100.

The Tour pros spend 50% of their practice time on putting alone. You should spend at least 70% of your practice on shots inside 50 yards.

## 6. Simplify Your Club Selection

When you are trying to break 100, having 14 clubs in the bag can create more confusion than benefit.

**The problem:** Standing over a 150-yard shot, debating between a 6-iron you sometimes hit well and a 7-iron that might be too short, creates doubt. Doubt leads to tentative swings. Tentative swings lead to poor contact.

**A simpler approach for your first 100-breaking rounds:**

- **Off the tee:** Driver or 3-wood/hybrid (whichever is more reliable)
- **Long approaches:** One hybrid or fairway wood you trust
- **Mid approaches:** 7-iron
- **Short approaches:** Pitching wedge
- **Around the green:** Sand wedge or 8-iron for chips
- **Putter**

That is six or seven clubs doing the work of fourteen. Each one has a specific job, and you hit it enough times that you actually know your distances.

For more on picking the right club for each situation, see our [club selection guide](/blog/golf-club-selection-guide/).

### Know Your Real Distances

Most golfers overestimate how far they hit each club by 10-15 yards. That is why they consistently miss greens short.

Before your next round, spend 20 minutes at the range tracking actual carry distances with your most important clubs: driver, hybrid, 7-iron, pitching wedge. Use a GPS app or range markers to get honest numbers.

Then trust those numbers on the course. If your 7-iron really goes 140 yards (not the 155 you thought), club up without hesitation.

## 7. Build a Pre-Shot Routine

Watch golfers shooting 110 and you will notice something: they often walk up to the ball and swing without much thought. Watch golfers shooting 85 and you will see a consistent routine before every shot.

A [pre-shot routine](/blog/golf-pre-shot-routine/) does three things:

1. **Calms your nerves.** Following a familiar pattern reduces anxiety.
2. **Focuses your mind.** You are thinking about the process, not the outcome.
3. **Creates consistency.** Same routine, same swing trigger, more predictable results.

### A Simple Routine for Breaking 100

**Behind the ball (10 seconds):**
- Pick your target
- Visualize the shot shape
- Choose your club

**At address (5 seconds):**
- One practice swing
- Align the clubface to your target
- Settle into your stance

**Execute:**
- One clear swing thought
- Commit and swing

That is 15 seconds total. It is not slow play. It is smart play.

The key is consistency. Use the same routine for your driver, your wedges, and your 4-foot putts. The familiarity creates confidence.

## Bonus: Use Video to Find Your Weak Spots

Here is something that accelerates improvement: you cannot fix what you cannot see.

Most golfers have no idea what their swing actually looks like. They feel like they are making a full turn, but video shows they are barely rotating. They think they are hitting down on the ball, but video reveals they are scooping.

Recording your swing, even with just your phone, provides objective feedback. You can see where you are leaking strokes and focus your practice accordingly.

AI swing analyzers take this further by automatically identifying specific issues. Instead of guessing what to work on, you get feedback on exactly what is costing you shots. It is like having a coach in your pocket who can watch every swing.

## The Mental Game: Patience Wins

Breaking 100 requires patience more than power.

After a bad hole, the temptation is to "get those strokes back" by taking extra risks. This almost always backfires. Each hole is a fresh start. What happened on the last hole is done.

Similarly, resist the urge to change your game plan mid-round because you saw another golfer hit a great shot with a different approach. Stick to your bogey-golf strategy. Trust the process.

And remember: you do not need 18 good holes. You need zero catastrophic holes and a bunch of manageable ones. If you make a double bogey, that is fine. Just avoid the triple or worse that follows from frustration.

## Your 100-Breaking Action Plan

Here is how to put this all together:

**This week:**
- Write down your actual carry distances for your key clubs
- Decide which tees you will play from (hint: probably one set forward)
- Identify the 2-3 holes on your home course where you typically blow up

**Your next practice session:**
- Spend 20 minutes on lag putting from 25-30 feet
- Spend 20 minutes on basic chip shots
- Spend 20 minutes hitting your most reliable clubs (hybrid, 7-iron, wedge)

**Your next round:**
- Plan for bogey on every hole
- When in trouble, take the safe out
- Use your pre-shot routine on every shot
- Accept that you will hit bad shots, and move on without compounding mistakes

Breaking 100 is within reach. It does not require a new swing, new equipment, or lessons from a tour pro. It requires smart decisions, a focus on short game, and the discipline to avoid self-inflicted disasters.

Shoot 9 bogeys and 9 doubles. That is 99. You can do this.
