Nobody talks about the shank in a normal voice. It gets whispered, like a curse. And for good reason: the shank is the most demoralizing shot in golf. A slice goes right. A hook goes left. A shank goes sideways at a 45-degree angle and might hit your cart.

If you are dealing with the shanks right now, take a breath. You are not alone, and this is fixable. The shank actually tells you something specific about your swing, and once you understand it, you can eliminate it.

## What Is a Shank, Exactly?

A shank happens when the ball strikes the hosel of the club instead of the face. The hosel is the round part where the clubhead connects to the shaft. When the ball hits there, it rockets off at a sharp angle to the right (for right-handed golfers).

The frustrating part? A shank often feels like solid contact. You hit the ball with something hard, it makes a decent sound, and then it flies sideways. Your brain cannot reconcile the feel with the result.

Understanding the mechanics helps remove the mystery. The ball is simply hitting the wrong part of the club, about an inch closer to your body than intended.

## The Four Main Causes of Shanks

Shanks do not come from one universal cause. But they almost always trace back to one of these four issues.

### 1. Standing Too Close to the Ball

This is the most common cause for recreational golfers. When you set up too close to the ball, your swing becomes too upright, and your arms have no room to swing freely. The result: the club returns to impact with the hosel in front of the ball.

Quick test: At address, you should be able to fit a fist between the butt end of the club and your thigh. If you cannot, you are probably too close.

Your [setup and stance](/blog/golf-setup-stance/) create the foundation for everything that follows. Get this wrong, and you are fighting an uphill battle.

### 2. Weight Distribution Problems

When your weight stays on your heels or shifts toward the ball during the swing, you become unstable. Your body compensates by moving the club outward to maintain balance. That outward movement puts the hosel where the clubface should be.

Proper [weight transfer](/blog/golf-weight-transfer/) moves your pressure into your lead foot through impact while keeping your body's distance from the ball consistent. When weight moves toward your toes during the downswing, your arms get pushed out, and shanks follow.

### 3. Excessive Hand Action

Too much wrist movement, especially extension (cupping) through impact, opens the clubface and can push the hosel toward the ball. When your hands get overly active and "flippy," you lose control of where the club delivers.

Good [club face control](/blog/club-face-control/) comes from the body rotating through impact, not from aggressive hand manipulation. When you try to steer the club with your hands, you introduce variables that make consistent contact nearly impossible.

### 4. Swing Path Issues

An excessively outside-to-in swing path with an open face is a recipe for shanks. The club approaches from outside the ball, and if the face is also open, the hosel leads the way into the ball.

This often combines with early extension, where your hips thrust toward the ball through impact. When your body moves closer to the ball in the downswing, your arms get pushed outward, putting the hosel in the danger zone.

The proper [downswing sequence](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/) keeps your body rotating while maintaining the space you created at address. When that sequence breaks down, shanks can appear.

## Why Shanks Come in Bunches

Here is something maddening about shanks: they tend to come in streaks. You shank one, and suddenly you shank three more in a row. Why?

The answer is mostly mental. After one shank, your brain tries to fix the problem. Usually, you try to "stay away" from the ball or swing more to the left. These compensations often make things worse because they do not address the actual cause.

Additionally, tension increases after a shank. Tighter grip, tighter arms, tighter swing. Tension restricts your natural movement and makes it harder for your body to return the club to a good position.

The key to breaking a shank streak: slow down, take a breath, and work through one of the drills below before hitting another full shot. Do not try to "just hit another one and see what happens."

## 7 Drills to Stop Shanking

These drills address the various causes of shanks. Start with the first two to identify your issue, then focus on the drills that target your specific problem.

### Drill 1: The Toe Strike Drill

This drill retrains your strike location and gives immediate feedback.

**Setup**: Place a tee in the ground about half an inch outside the toe of your club at address. The goal is to hit the ball without hitting the tee.

**Execution**: Make half swings at 50% speed. Focus on striking the ball on the toe side of center. Do not aim for the absolute toe, just away from the heel.

**Why it works**: This shifts your entire strike pattern away from the hosel. You are not trying to hit every shot off the toe, but you are training your brain that "center" is actually further from your body than you thought.

### Drill 2: The Two-Ball Drill

This classic drill reveals whether you are hitting the hosel and helps retrain your path.

**Setup**: Place two balls about one clubhead-width apart, parallel to your target line. Address the outer ball (the one farther from you).

**Execution**: Swing and try to hit only the inner ball. Your arms need to pull in slightly to miss the outer ball.

**Why it works**: If you shank, you will hit the outer ball (or both). This drill forces you to feel the arms working more around your body rather than out toward the ball.

### Drill 3: The Obstacle Drill

This is similar to the two-ball drill but with clearer feedback.

**Setup**: Place a range bucket, headcover, or cardboard box just outside the ball on the target line. It should be close enough that an outside-in path would hit it.

**Execution**: Hit shots without touching the obstacle. Start with half swings.

**Why it works**: An over-the-top, outside-in path cannot survive this drill. You must swing from the inside to avoid the obstacle, which naturally moves the hosel away from the ball.

### Drill 4: The Motorcycle Drill

This addresses excessive wrist extension that opens the face and exposes the hosel.

**Setup**: Take your normal address position with a mid-iron.

**Execution**: In your takeaway and early downswing, feel like you are revving a motorcycle with your lead wrist. This bowing motion closes the face earlier and squares the club without relying on hand manipulation at impact.

**Why it works**: When the face squares earlier in the downswing (not at the last millisecond), there is less chance of the hosel leading into the ball. You also reduce the need for compensations that cause shanks.

### Drill 5: The Bank and Roll Drill

This stops your body from lunging toward the ball, which is a primary cause of shanks.

**Setup**: Take your normal address position.

**Execution**: In the downswing, feel your trail knee move toward your lead knee rather than driving forward toward the ball. Think of your lower body "banking" to the side like a cyclist leaning into a turn.

**Why it works**: When your hips drive toward the ball, you run out of space and your arms have to go somewhere, usually out toward the hosel. This drill keeps your hips back and preserves the space you created at address.

### Drill 6: The Arms-Connected Drill

This prevents your arms from getting disconnected and swinging out away from your body.

**Setup**: Place a glove or small towel under both armpits at address.

**Execution**: Hit half and three-quarter shots while keeping the objects in place. If your arms disconnect and swing outward, the objects will fall.

**Why it works**: Connected arms naturally swing on a more circular path around your body. Disconnected arms tend to swing out toward the ball, putting the hosel in play.

### Drill 7: The Distance Check Drill

This drill ensures you are the correct distance from the ball at address.

**Setup**: Address the ball normally. Without changing your posture, let go of the club with your trail hand. Your trail hand should hang naturally about a fist-width from the club.

**Execution**: If your hand is touching the club or pressed against your thigh, you are too close. If it hangs far outside the club, you may be too far. Adjust and hit shots from the correct distance.

**Why it works**: Proper distance from the ball is the foundation. All the swing fixes in the world cannot overcome a fundamentally flawed setup.

## Quick Fixes for the Course

You cannot do extensive drill work on the course, but you can make adjustments.

**Check your distance from the ball.** If in doubt, stand slightly farther away than feels natural. Better to hit a few toe shots than continue shanking.

**Lighten your grip pressure.** Tension causes all kinds of problems. A lighter grip allows your arms to swing more freely.

**Feel the club swing around you, not at the ball.** Think of your swing as a circle around your body, not a line toward the target.

**Slow down your transition.** Rushing from the top is a common trigger. Take an extra beat before starting down.

**Pick a target on the ball.** Focus on the inside quadrant of the ball, the part closest to you. This subtle focus shift can move your strike point away from the hosel.

## How Video Analysis Helps

Here is the challenge with shanks: you often cannot feel what is causing them. You might feel like you are swinging normally, but video reveals the truth.

When you record your swing and watch it frame by frame, you can see:

- Whether you are standing too close at address
- If your body moves toward the ball in the downswing
- Whether your arms disconnect and swing outward
- How your wrist angles change through impact

[AI swing analyzers](/blog/how-ai-analyzes-golf-swing/) can identify these patterns automatically, showing you exactly where your club is at [impact](/blog/golf-impact-position/) and whether you are setting up for a hosel strike.

The shank is frustrating partly because it feels random. Video takes the randomness away by showing you the cause.

## The Mental Side of Shanks

Once you have shanked a few shots, your brain remembers. Standing over a pitch shot, you might feel fear instead of confidence. That fear causes tension, which causes more shanks. The cycle feeds itself.

Breaking this cycle requires two things.

First, you need a physical fix. One of the drills above, practiced until you trust it. You need to hit enough good shots in practice that your brain has new evidence.

Second, you need to accept that shanks might happen again. If you play golf long enough, you will shank occasionally. The goal is not perfection but resilience. Shank one, fix your setup, make a smooth swing, and move on.

Golfers who fear the shank give it power. Golfers who understand the shank take that power away.

## A Practice Plan for Shank Recovery

If you are currently struggling with shanks, here is a structured approach.

**Session 1: Diagnosis (20 minutes)**
Hit 10-15 balls at half speed, paying attention to where contact happens. Use impact tape or foot spray on the clubface if available. Do the distance check drill and two-ball drill to identify your pattern.

**Session 2: Drill Work (30 minutes)**
Based on your diagnosis, pick 2-3 drills from the list above. Spend 10 minutes on each, hitting balls at 50-75% speed. Do not worry about where the ball goes. Focus on the feeling each drill creates.

**Session 3: Integration (30 minutes)**
Alternate between drill swings and normal swings. Hit three drill shots, then one normal shot. Gradually increase the proportion of normal swings as contact improves.

**Session 4: Confidence Building (20 minutes)**
Hit only shots you are confident about. If that means half-swing pitch shots, fine. Build up to fuller swings only when you are ready. End on a positive note.

## The Path Forward

The shank is not a life sentence. It is a symptom with identifiable causes and proven fixes.

Most shanks come from one of four issues: standing too close, poor weight distribution, excessive hand action, or a swing path that puts the hosel in play. Drills that address these causes work quickly, often within a single practice session.

The goal is to understand your shank, not fear it. Once you know why it happens, you can prevent it.

Millions of golfers have overcome the shanks. You will too.
