The fade is golf's most reliable shot shape. That gentle left-to-right curve (for right-handed golfers) has been the go-to shot for legends like Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, and Lee Trevino. There's a reason they trusted it under pressure.

Unlike a draw, which can turn into a hook without warning, a fade rarely becomes a disaster. It lands softer, holds greens better, and gives you more control when you need it most.

Ready to add this weapon to your game? Here's everything you need to know about how to hit a fade in golf.

## What Is a Fade Shot in Golf?

A fade is a controlled shot that starts slightly left of your target and curves gently back to the right, finishing on or near the target line. For left-handed golfers, it curves the opposite direction.

The key word is controlled. A fade is not a slice. While both curve left-to-right, a slice is unintentional and excessive. A fade moves maybe 5-15 yards sideways. A slice can miss by 50 yards or more.

### Fade vs Draw: Which Is Better?

Neither is inherently superior. Both have their place.

**The fade offers:**
- Higher trajectory and softer landing
- More backspin for holding greens
- Easier to control under pressure
- Less likely to turn into a severe miss

**The draw offers:**
- More distance (lower spin means more roll)
- Better for fighting right-to-left wind
- Helps navigate certain hole shapes

Most amateurs should learn both, but many find the fade easier to repeat. The slightly open face at impact is more forgiving than the closed face required for a draw. For a complete comparison and guidance on the draw, see our [how to hit a draw guide](/blog/how-to-hit-a-draw-golf/).

## The Physics Behind the Fade

Understanding why the ball curves helps you control the curve.

Ball flight depends on two factors at impact:

1. **Clubface angle** determines where the ball starts (about 75-85% of starting direction)
2. **Swing path relative to clubface** determines how much and which direction it curves

For a fade, you need:

- **Clubface pointing at your target** (or slightly left of it)
- **Swing path traveling left of where the face points** (out-to-in for right-handers)
- **Face open to the swing path**, creating the left-to-right spin

The ball starts where the face points, then curves away from the path direction. Face pointing at target, path going left of that, ball starts at target and fades right. Simple physics, once you understand it.

## Why Legends Played the Fade

Ben Hogan famously rebuilt his swing around the fade after battling a hook early in his career. He called the hook a "terror" and considered the fade far more predictable.

Jack Nicklaus won 18 majors playing predominantly a fade. His philosophy: aim at the left edge of the fairway and fade it back to the middle. The right side was never in play.

Lee Trevino made a career out of his distinctive fade. His setup and swing were engineered specifically to produce left-to-right ball flight, and he won six majors with it.

What did they all understand? The fade has a built-in safety margin. An overdone fade becomes a weak slice that bleeds distance but stays in play. An overdone draw becomes a snap hook that can find serious trouble in a hurry.

## Step 1: Adjust Your Grip for a Fade

Your grip is the foundation of clubface control. To hit a fade, you want a grip that promotes a slightly open face at impact.

### Weaken Your Grip Slightly

For most golfers, this means rotating your hands counterclockwise on the club (for right-handers):

1. **Lead hand (left for righties)**: Rotate it counterclockwise until you see only 1.5-2 knuckles when looking down, instead of the typical 2-2.5
2. **Trail hand (right for righties)**: Position it more on top of the club, with the V between thumb and forefinger pointing toward your chin or lead shoulder

This adjustment keeps the face from closing too quickly through impact. You don't need to manipulate anything mid-swing. The grip does the work.

**Important**: Make small changes. A slightly weaker grip encourages a fade. An extremely weak grip creates slices. For a deeper understanding of how grip affects your ball flight, read our [golf grip guide](/blog/golf-grip-guide/).

## Step 2: Set Up Your Alignment for a Fade

Your alignment is where the fade really takes shape. This is the opposite of draw alignment, so pay attention.

### Open Your Stance

1. **Aim your clubface** directly at your target
2. **Align your feet, hips, and shoulders** slightly left of target (for right-handers)
3. **This open stance** promotes the out-to-in swing path that creates fade spin

Think of it as giving the ball room to curve. You're setting up to swing across the ball from outside to inside, while the face points at your target.

### How Open Should You Be?

Start with your feet aimed 5-10 yards left of target. Your shoulders should follow your foot line. The more open you set up, the more the ball will fade. Keep it subtle initially.

For detailed alignment fundamentals, including the intermediate target technique, see our [golf alignment and aim guide](/blog/golf-alignment-aim/).

### Ball Position for the Fade

Move the ball slightly forward in your stance, about half a ball width ahead of where you'd normally play it. This encourages contact when the club is already traveling back to the left, enhancing the fade spin.

A forward ball position also promotes a slightly higher launch, which works perfectly with the fade's tendency to land softly.

## Step 3: Modify Your Swing Path

With the proper grip and alignment, your swing path adjustments become smaller. You're not fighting your setup. You're working with it.

### Swing Along Your Body Line

Here's the key: swing along your foot line, not at the target. Since your body is aimed left, swinging along your body naturally creates the out-to-in path you need.

Don't try to steer the club across the ball. Just swing normally along your stance line. The geometry handles the rest.

### Feel the Outside-In Path

Some golfers find it helpful to feel like they're swinging toward the left side of the fairway (or even the left rough). This exaggerates the path sensation but often produces the proper subtle fade path in reality.

Another useful image: feel like your hands are moving toward the target while the clubhead is moving slightly left of it.

### Keep the Face Stable

Through impact, resist the urge to release the club aggressively. A hard release closes the face and fights the fade. Instead, feel like the back of your lead hand stays pointing at the target longer through impact.

This doesn't mean holding off the release entirely. It means delaying it slightly, keeping the face a touch open to your path.

## Step 4: Clubface Control for the Fade

The clubface determines where the ball starts. For a fade, you want it pointing at your target or very slightly left of it at impact.

### Lead Wrist Position

At the top of your backswing, your lead wrist should be flat or very slightly cupped (bent backward). A bowed wrist closes the face and promotes draws.

Through impact, maintain a small amount of extension in your lead wrist. This keeps the face from snapping closed. Think of it as keeping the logo on your glove pointing at the target through the hitting zone.

### The Open Face Feel

Many fade players describe the sensation as "holding the face open" through impact. This doesn't mean manipulating the club. It means allowing the natural geometry of your setup and grip to produce a face that's open to the path while pointing at the target.

## Common Mistakes When Learning the Fade

### Mistake 1: Aiming Right and Slicing

Some golfers aim right and try to slice it back. This rarely works. You end up with an unpredictable slice that goes anywhere. The proper fade starts left of target and curves back. Aim left with your body, not right.

### Mistake 2: Grip Too Weak

There's a difference between a slightly weaker grip and a dramatically weak grip. Go too far and you'll hit high, weak slices that lose 30 yards. Make small adjustments and test the results.

### Mistake 3: Swinging Too Steeply

An out-to-in path doesn't mean chopping down on the ball. Some golfers associate "outside-in" with a steep, over-the-top move. That produces pulled shots and weak cuts. Keep your swing plane reasonable while simply redirecting the path slightly left.

### Mistake 4: Not Committing

Half-hearted fades become unpredictable. If you set up for a fade but then try to square everything up through impact, you'll get random results. Commit to the setup, trust the process, and let the ball curve.

### Mistake 5: Forgetting the Fundamentals

A fade built on poor fundamentals won't last. Make sure your [setup and stance](/blog/golf-setup-stance/) are solid before adding shot shaping. Trying to hit a fade with a flawed foundation creates compensations that break down under pressure.

## 4 Drills to Groove Your Fade

### Drill 1: The Gate Drill

Set up two tees or alignment sticks creating a gate about 6 inches in front of your ball. Position the gate so it's aimed slightly left of your target.

Your job: swing the club through the gate after impact. This trains the out-to-in path. If you're coming too far from the inside, you'll miss the gate to the right.

Start with half swings and work up to full swings only when the path is consistent.

### Drill 2: Alignment Stick Visual

Place one alignment stick on the ground pointing at your target. Place a second stick along your toe line, pointed 10-15 degrees left of the first.

Hit balls while maintaining this setup. The visual reinforcement helps your brain accept the open stance. Many golfers subconsciously close their stance because aiming left feels wrong. The sticks keep you honest.

### Drill 3: The Glove Under Arm Drill

Tuck a glove or small towel under your lead armpit. Hit shots while keeping it in place through impact.

This drill prevents your arms from running away from your body, which can cause over-rotation and a closed face. Keeping the connection promotes the stable face position you need for consistent fades.

### Drill 4: The 9 O'Clock Drill

Make swings that stop at 9 o'clock in the follow-through (club pointing at the target, roughly parallel to the ground). Hold this position for a beat.

At this checkpoint, examine your clubface. Is it pointing slightly toward the sky? That's a fade position. Is it pointing at the ground? That's a draw or hook position.

This drill builds awareness of face position through impact without the chaos of a full finish.

## Hitting a Fade With Driver vs. Irons

The fundamentals stay the same, but feel differs between clubs.

### Driver Fade

With driver, you're hitting up on the ball. The ascending strike naturally reduces spin, so you may need a slightly more open setup to see the same amount of fade.

Tee the ball at your normal height or slightly higher. The forward ball position combined with the tee height makes it easier to catch the ball with a slightly open face.

Driver fades are particularly useful off the tee when trouble lurks on the left side. Start the ball down the left edge and let it work back to the middle of the fairway.

### Iron Fade

With irons, you're hitting down on the ball. The descending blow creates more backspin, which can enhance the fade effect. You may see a slightly higher, softer ball flight.

For approach shots, the fade's soft landing is a significant advantage. You can attack pins on the left side of greens, knowing the ball will hold rather than release.

### Wedge Fade

Short game fades are useful for specific situations, like a pin tucked on the right with trouble on the left. The technique is the same but scaled down. Open stance, face at target, swing along your body line.

Keep the motion smooth. Trying to manufacture spin with wedges often leads to mishits.

## When to Use the Fade on the Course

Knowing how to hit a fade is only half the battle. Knowing when to use it makes you a smarter golfer.

### Dogleg Right Holes

When the fairway curves to the right, a fade matches the hole shape. Your ball curves with the fairway instead of fighting it.

### Pins on the Right Side

Fades land softly and don't release much. When the pin is on the right and you're approaching from the fairway, a fade holds the green better than a draw, which would release toward the edge.

### Trouble on the Left

If there's water, out of bounds, or thick rough on the left, a fade eliminates that side of the course. Start down the left edge, fade it back, and the left miss becomes nearly impossible.

### Right-to-Left Wind

A fade into a right-to-left wind creates a relatively straight ball flight. The wind pushes left while your fade pushes right. They cancel out.

### Tight Fairways

When accuracy matters more than distance, the fade's predictability shines. You give up a few yards of roll, but you hit more fairways.

## How Video Analysis Helps Your Fade

The difference between a crisp fade and a weak slice often comes down to a few degrees of face angle or path. You can't feel these small differences in real time.

Video analysis reveals the truth. Record your swing from behind (down the target line) and look for:

- Is your path actually going left of your face angle?
- How much is your face open to the path?
- Are you maintaining wrist position through impact?

AI swing analyzers can measure your exact path and face angle, showing you whether your fade fundamentals are dialed in or need adjustment. What feels like a fade might actually be a pull-slice on camera.

See your swing path with video analysis. When you know your actual numbers, you can make precise adjustments instead of guessing.

## Building Your Fade: A Practice Plan

**Week 1: Grip and Setup**
Focus entirely on the grip and stance changes. Hit half swings with a 7-iron, just getting comfortable with the new positions. Don't worry about ball flight yet.

**Week 2: Path Training**
Add the gate drill and alignment stick drill. Start connecting the setup to the swing path. You should see balls starting left and curving right, even if inconsistently.

**Week 3: Full Swings**
Graduate to full swings while maintaining the fundamentals. Film yourself to verify your path and face. Make adjustments based on what you see, not what you feel.

**Week 4: Course Integration**
Take your fade to the course. Start with low-pressure situations where a straight shot would also work. As confidence builds, use the fade in situations that demand it.

## Quick Reference: Fade Checklist

- Grip: Slightly weaker (see 1.5-2 knuckles on lead hand)
- Clubface: Aimed at target
- Body alignment: Feet, hips, shoulders left of target
- Ball position: Slightly forward of normal
- Swing path: Out-to-in (along body line)
- Face at impact: Open to path, pointing at target
- Through impact: Stable lead wrist, don't over-release

Master these elements and the fade becomes a shot you can trust when it matters most.
