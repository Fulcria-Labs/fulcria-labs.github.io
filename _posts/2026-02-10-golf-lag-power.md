# Golf Lag: The Secret to Effortless Power

You've seen the photos. Tour pros at the halfway down point with their wrists still fully hinged, the club pointing almost straight up at the sky. It looks like they're storing incredible power.

And they are. But not in the way most golfers think.

Lag is one of the most misunderstood concepts in golf. Trying to "hold" your lag is one of the fastest ways to lose it. Here's what's actually happening—and how to let lag work for you.

## What Is Lag, Really?

Lag is simply the angle between your lead arm and the club shaft during the downswing. At the top of your backswing, your wrists are hinged and the club is behind you. As you start down, that angle should be maintained before releasing through impact.

The key word: *maintained*. Not forced. Not held.

When you see a tour pro with incredible lag, you're seeing the result of proper sequencing, not conscious wrist manipulation.

## Why You Lose Lag

Most amateurs cast the club early—releasing that wrist angle before impact. This happens for two reasons:

**1. Arms lead the downswing**

When your hands and arms start the downswing, the club naturally releases too early. You're essentially throwing the clubhead at the ball from the top.

**2. Trying to hit the ball**

Your brain knows the ball is down there. So it instinctively wants to get the clubhead to the ball as quickly as possible. This "hit instinct" causes early release.

## The Counterintuitive Truth

Here's what creates lag in a good golf swing:

**The lower body leads.**

When your hips start the downswing while your shoulders and arms are still completing the backswing, you create a stretch. This stretch naturally keeps the wrist angle intact.

You don't hold lag. You create the conditions for lag to happen.

## What Holding Lag Feels Like

If you consciously try to hold lag:
- Your forearms tense up
- You lose clubhead speed
- You hit weak shots to the right (for right-handers)
- You feel like you're "blocking" through impact

Real lag feels like nothing. That's because it's happening automatically as a result of good sequencing.

## Simple Drill: The Step Drill

This is one of the best ways to feel natural lag:

1. Take your normal setup
2. Bring your lead foot back next to your trail foot
3. Make a backswing
4. As you start down, step toward the target with your lead foot
5. Let your arms and club follow

The step forward forces your lower body to lead. Your arms and club will lag behind naturally. You'll feel the whip at the bottom.

## What Good Lag Looks Like

In a properly sequenced swing:

| Downswing Phase | What's Happening |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Start | Hips shift and rotate toward target |
| Midway | Shoulders start to turn, arms drop |
| Late | Wrists still hinged, club approaching the ball |
| Impact | Wrists release, maximum speed delivered to ball |

The release happens late and fast—not because you held it, but because everything before it happened in the right order.

## Check Your Own Lag

Want to see how much lag you're creating? Record your swing from down the line (facing you from behind the ball). Look at the halfway down position.

If the club shaft is pointing at or above your shoulder, you're maintaining lag.

If it's pointing at your waist or below, you're casting.

## The Real Power Move

Stop thinking about lag. Start thinking about sequence.

Hip bump, then hip rotation, then shoulders, then arms, then club. Get that chain working properly and lag takes care of itself.

The best swings feel effortless because they are. The club does the work when you let physics happen.

**Quick Summary:**
- Lag is the angle between your arm and club shaft
- Trying to hold lag usually kills it
- Lower body leading the downswing creates lag naturally
- The step drill helps you feel proper sequencing
- Record your swing to check your lag position
