# Golf Lag: How to Create and Keep It for Maximum Distance

Lag is the difference between hitting the ball 220 yards and 260 yards. Every tour player has it. Most amateur golfers lose it before impact.

If you've ever felt like you're swinging hard but the ball goes nowhere, you're probably casting—releasing your wrist angle too early and wasting all that stored energy before it reaches the ball.

Let's fix that.

## What Is Lag (Really)?

Lag is the angle between your lead arm and the club shaft during the downswing. When you've properly set your wrists at the top, you create roughly a 90-degree angle. Lag is your ability to maintain that angle deep into the downswing before releasing it through impact.

Think of it this way: your hands lead, and the clubhead trails behind. The longer the clubhead stays behind your hands on the way down, the more lag you have.

This creates a whip effect. Just like cracking a whip requires the tip to trail behind before snapping forward, your clubhead needs to lag behind your hands before releasing through the ball.

Here's the physics: holding the angle longer means the club releases faster right when you need it—at impact. Release too early (casting), and peak clubhead speed happens before you even reach the ball.

## Why You Lose Lag (The Casting Problem)

Most golfers instinctively try to hit at the ball. The moment the downswing starts, they throw the club at the ball with their hands. This feels powerful but does the opposite.

Common causes of casting:

### Hitting From the Top
The urge to use your hands immediately in the downswing. Your body hasn't started rotating yet, so your only option is to throw the clubhead.

### Tension in the Hands
Gripping too tight triggers an early release. Tight muscles don't allow the natural release timing that creates lag.

### Wrong Sequence
Starting the downswing with your arms instead of your lower body. When your arms go first, they have nowhere to go but out—and that means releasing the angle.

### Ball Focus
Staring at the ball and trying to hit at it. This creates a scooping motion rather than a descending blow.

## How to Create Lag (The Right Way)

You don't create lag by trying to hold the angle. That leads to tension and a blocked feeling. Lag happens naturally when you sequence your downswing correctly.

### Start From the Ground

Your downswing should initiate with your lower body. As your hips start rotating toward the target, your arms and club will naturally trail behind. This trailing is lag.

Think about throwing a ball. Your legs and hips start first, then your torso, then your arm, then your hand. The club follows the same sequence.

### Let Your Hands Drop

From the top of your swing, feel like your hands drop straight down while your hips rotate. This creates a sensation of the club shallowing and your hands staying close to your body.

### Maintain a Soft Grip Pressure

On a scale of 1-10 (10 being maximum pressure), keep your grip around 4-5. Lighter grip pressure allows the wrists to stay hinged naturally without conscious effort.

### Delay the Hit

Instead of hitting at the ball, feel like you're hitting past it—toward a spot a foot in front of the ball. This delays your release naturally.

## Drills to Build Lag

### The Pump Drill

Take your backswing to the top. Start your downswing by dropping your hands, but stop when your hands reach waist height. Check: is the clubhead still above your hands? It should be. Pump back to the top and repeat 3-4 times before hitting.

### Slow Motion Swings

Make swings at 50% speed and focus on keeping the club behind your hands as long as possible. You'll actually feel the lag because you're moving slowly enough to be aware of the positions.

### The Towel Drill

Put a small towel under your lead armpit. Make swings trying to keep the towel in place until after impact. This forces your arms to stay connected to your body rotation, which naturally creates lag.

### Impact Bag Practice

Hit an impact bag with an iron. Feel your hands reaching the bag before the clubhead does. This builds the motor pattern of hands-leading impact.

## What Lag Should Feel Like

Real lag feels like:
- The clubhead is heavy and trailing behind
- Your hands are leading toward the target
- The release happens automatically, not forced
- Speed happens at the bottom, not the top

Real lag does NOT feel like:
- Actively holding an angle
- Fighting against the club
- Tension in your forearms
- The club is stuck behind you

If you're trying to hold lag, you're doing it wrong. Lag should feel effortless—like the club wants to stay back because you're sequencing correctly.

## Common Lag Myths

### "I need to consciously hold the angle"
No. Conscious holding creates tension, which actually makes you release earlier. Lag comes from proper sequence, not willpower.

### "More lag is always better"
Not true. Too much lag (often called getting "stuck") leads to blocks and hooks. You want enough lag for power, but you also need to release through the ball.

### "Lag is only for long hitters"
Every good ball striker has lag, regardless of swing speed. It's about efficiency, not just distance. Better lag means better contact, even for slower swingers.

## Signs You're Improving

How do you know your lag is getting better?

1. **Divots move forward** - You're hitting down on the ball, taking divots after the ball
2. **Contact improves** - Shots feel solid without trying harder
3. **Ball flight is lower** - A compressed strike launches lower with more spin
4. **Clubs go farther** - Without swinging harder, you pick up 5-15 yards per club

## Put It Together

Lag isn't something you manufacture—it's something that happens when your sequence is right. Focus on:

1. Start the downswing with your lower body
2. Let your hands drop while maintaining soft grip pressure
3. Trust that the release will happen naturally
4. Swing through the ball, not at it

The feeling you're after is one of effortless power. When lag works, the ball explodes off the face without the sensation of hitting hard.

Master this, and you'll wonder where all that extra distance came from.
