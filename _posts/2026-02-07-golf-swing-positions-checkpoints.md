![5 Key Golf Swing Positions Every Golfer Should Check](/assets/images/golf-swing-positions-checkpoints.png)

The golf swing happens in about one second. In that brief window, your body moves through dozens of positions, any of which can make or break the shot.

But here's the good news: you don't need to monitor everything. Tour instructors and elite coaches focus on just five key checkpoints. Master these positions, and the pieces between them tend to fall into place.

This guide breaks down each checkpoint, explains what it should look like, identifies common errors, and gives you practical ways to check yourself using nothing more than a mirror or your phone's camera.

## Why Swing Positions Matter

Your golf swing is a chain reaction. Each position sets up the next. A flawed address creates a compensating backswing. A poor backswing forces a difficult transition. And so on.

The five key positions act as quality gates. Check these positions regularly, and you catch problems before they cascade into full-swing faults that take weeks to fix.

Think of it like checkpoints in a race. You don't need to track every footstep, but you do need to verify you're on course at key intervals.

## Position 1: Address (Setup)

Everything starts here. Your address position determines how your body can move for the rest of the swing. Get this wrong, and you'll fight compensations from the first moment.

### What It Should Look Like

**From down the line (behind you):**
- Spine tilted forward approximately 30-40 degrees from vertical
- Arms hanging naturally from shoulders, not reaching or cramped
- Weight balanced between the balls of your feet and heels
- Knees slightly flexed, not locked or deeply bent
- Club extending to the ball without reaching or crowding

**From face-on:**
- Feet approximately shoulder-width apart (wider for driver, narrower for wedges)
- Weight evenly distributed between both feet, or slightly favoring the lead foot
- Shoulders, hips, and feet aligned parallel left of the target line
- Ball position appropriate for the club (forward for driver, center for wedges)

### Common Address Errors

**Standing too close:** Your arms are cramped against your body, forcing a steep, armsy swing.

**Standing too far:** You're reaching for the ball, losing balance and promoting an outside-in path.

**Weight on heels:** You'll fall backward during the swing and struggle with consistent contact.

**Hunched posture:** Rounding your shoulders restricts rotation and leads to back pain.

**Locked knees:** Stiff legs prevent proper weight transfer and hip rotation.

### How to Check It

**Mirror drill:** Stand in front of a full-length mirror in your address position. Check your spine angle, knee flex, and arm hang. Compare to photos of tour pros at address.

**Butt-to-wall test:** Set up with your rear end touching a wall behind you. This ensures proper distance from the ball and correct hip hinge.

**Club-on-spine test:** Have someone place a club along your spine at address. It should touch your tailbone, mid-back, and back of your head. If you're hunched, it won't touch all three.

## Position 2: Top of Backswing

The top of your backswing is where you store energy. This position determines how much power you can generate and whether you're set up for an efficient downswing or fighting from a compromised position.

### What It Should Look Like

**From down the line:**
- Club shaft roughly parallel to the target line (not laid off or across the line)
- Lead arm relatively straight (not rigid, but not bent beyond 10 degrees)
- Club points at or slightly inside the target line
- Clubface angle matches your lead forearm (square position)

**From face-on:**
- Shoulders turned approximately 90 degrees (back facing target)
- Hips turned approximately 45 degrees
- Weight shifted into the trail hip and foot
- Head relatively steady, with minimal lateral movement
- Lead knee pointing behind the ball

### Common Top-of-Backswing Errors

**Overswing:** The club dips past parallel, leading to loss of control and inconsistent timing.

**Lifting instead of turning:** Arms elevate while the body stays static, producing no coil and a narrow arc.

**Reverse pivot:** Weight stays on the lead foot instead of shifting to the trail side, destroying power and balance.

**Flying right elbow:** Trail elbow points away from the body instead of down, pushing the club across the line.

**Cupped lead wrist:** Excessive cupping opens the clubface, requiring compensation to square it at impact.

### How to Check It

**Video check:** Record your swing from down the line. Pause at the top and draw a line through the club shaft. Where does it point? It should aim at or inside the target.

**Mirror backswing drill:** Take slow-motion backswings in front of a mirror. Stop at the top and check your shoulder turn, weight distribution, and arm position.

**Back-to-target drill:** Practice swinging to the top and holding for two seconds. Can you feel your back facing the target? Is your weight in your trail hip?

**Knuckle count:** At the top, look at your lead hand. You should see 2-3 knuckles. More than that indicates a cupped wrist; fewer suggests excessive bowing.

Our [complete backswing guide](/blog/golf-backswing/) covers the proper sequence and drills in detail.

## Position 3: Transition and the Slot

The transition is the most critical quarter-second in golf. It's the moment your swing changes direction, and it's where most swings go wrong. Get here correctly, and impact almost takes care of itself.

### What It Should Look Like

**From down the line:**
- Club shallows (moves away from the ball) as the downswing begins
- Trail elbow drops toward the trail hip
- Hands drop rather than push outward
- The club "slots" into a position inside the backswing plane

**From face-on:**
- Hips begin moving toward the target while shoulders complete the backswing
- Weight shifts decisively to the lead foot
- Lead hip begins opening while trail shoulder stays back
- Hands start down while maintaining wrist angle

### Common Transition Errors

**Coming over the top:** The club steepens instead of shallowing, throwing it outside the proper path. This is the number one cause of slices.

**Rushing:** No pause or change of direction, just a frantic lunge at the ball.

**Arms-first downswing:** The shoulders and arms fire before the lower body shifts, destroying sequence and power.

**Spinning the hips:** Hips rotate too quickly without the initial lateral shift, leaving the arms behind.

**Early release (casting):** Wrist angles release immediately from the top, killing lag and power.

### How to Check It

**Slow-motion video:** Film at 120fps or higher and watch the first moment after your hands reach the top. Does the club shallow or steepen? Do your hips move first?

**Pause drill:** Swing to the top and pause for a full second. Then start down by pressing your lead foot into the ground. This forces proper sequencing because you can't rely on momentum.

**Shaft angle check:** In video, draw a line through the club at the top. Then draw another line through the club when your hands reach hip height on the downswing. The second line should be shallower than the first.

**The feel:** A good transition feels like the club is falling while your lower body leads. It should feel athletic, like throwing a ball.

## Position 4: Impact

Impact is the moment of truth. Everything you've done in the swing culminates in this split second of club-to-ball contact. The positions here determine ball flight, distance, and consistency.

### What It Should Look Like

**From down the line:**
- Hands ahead of the clubhead (shaft leaning toward the target)
- Clubface square to the target line
- Eyes on the ball, head behind ball position
- Trail arm still slightly bent
- Club path matching target line

**From face-on:**
- Approximately 80% of weight on the lead foot
- Hips open to target (30-45 degrees)
- Shoulders closer to square (10-20 degrees open)
- Lead shoulder higher than trail shoulder
- Lead wrist flat or slightly bowed

### Common Impact Errors

**Flipping:** Hands behind the clubhead, adding loft and producing fat or thin shots.

**Chicken wing:** Lead elbow bends and points toward the target, losing power and causing blocks.

**Early extension:** Body straightens and moves toward the ball, creating toe hits and inconsistent contact.

**Hanging back:** Weight stays on the trail foot, causing fat shots and weak ball flight.

**Cupped lead wrist:** Opens the clubface at impact, producing slices and added loft.

### How to Check It

**Impact bag drill:** Practice pressing into an impact bag or old duffel stuffed with towels. Hold the impact position for three seconds, feeling hands ahead, hips open, and weight forward.

**Towel drill:** Place a towel 4-6 inches behind the ball. If you hit the towel, you're flipping. Proper shaft lean contacts ball first.

**Freeze-frame video:** Use slow-motion video to pause exactly at impact. Check hand position relative to the clubhead, hip rotation, and weight distribution.

**Preset impact drill:** At address, move into an impact position: shift weight forward, open hips slightly, press hands ahead. Now swing back and return to that position.

## Position 5: Finish

The finish position reveals what happened in the swing. It's not something you consciously create during the shot, but checking it afterward tells you whether the swing worked.

### What It Should Look Like

**From down the line:**
- Club behind the head, over the lead shoulder
- Trail shoulder has rotated through toward the target
- Spine relatively vertical or slightly tilted toward the target
- Full extension has occurred through the ball

**From face-on:**
- Belt buckle facing the target or slightly past it
- Weight fully on the lead foot (trail heel off the ground)
- Lead leg relatively straight
- Balanced and still, not falling forward or backward
- Chest facing target

### Common Finish Errors

**Falling backward:** Weight stuck on the trail foot, indicating a hang-back through impact.

**Chicken wing finish:** Arms are bent and cramped instead of extended, showing deceleration through the ball.

**No rotation:** Body faces the ball instead of the target, revealing blocked rotation through impact.

**Off balance:** Stumbling after the swing indicates poor sequencing or over-swinging.

**Short finish:** The swing stops too early, showing deceleration or tension.

### How to Check It

**Balance test:** After every swing, hold your finish for three seconds. If you can't stay balanced, something went wrong earlier in the swing.

**Belt buckle check:** Where does your belt buckle point at finish? It should face the target or slightly left of it.

**Mirror finish drill:** Take full swings in front of a mirror and freeze at the finish. Check your rotation, balance, and arm position.

**Video comparison:** Watch tour pros finish and compare to your own. Note differences in rotation, balance, and extension.

## How to Use These Checkpoints

Don't try to monitor all five positions during a swing. That's impossible. Instead, use these checkpoints for diagnosis and practice.

### For Practice Sessions

**Pick one checkpoint per session.** Film yourself, check the position, identify any errors, and work on specific drills to address them. Trying to fix everything at once leads to paralysis.

**Use video regularly.** What you feel isn't always what's real. Film every practice session and check your key positions.

**Create comparison shots.** Save a video of your best swing. Compare your current positions to that baseline.

### For Self-Diagnosis

When your game goes south, check your positions in order:

1. **Address first.** Setup problems cause everything downstream. Fix address before moving on.
2. **Top of backswing.** Check your turn, arm position, and weight shift.
3. **Transition.** Look for over-the-top or early release.
4. **Impact.** Verify shaft lean and weight transfer.
5. **Finish.** Check balance and rotation.

Often, you'll find the root cause in address or transition, not impact. Impact is a result, not a cause.

### For Quick Self-Checks

**Before a round:** Hit a few balls and video your swing. Quick-check address and finish. Are you set up correctly? Are you finishing in balance?

**Mid-round reset:** If things go wrong on the course, check your address position. It's the one thing you can consciously control before every shot.

## Technology Makes It Easier

Checking swing positions used to require an instructor or hours of video study. Now, [AI swing analyzers](/blog/how-ai-analyzes-golf-swing/) can identify position errors automatically and provide instant feedback.

Modern apps can:
- Measure exact angles at each checkpoint
- Compare your positions to tour averages
- Track changes over time
- Provide specific drills for your issues

The key is turning what you see into action. Knowing your transition is steep only helps if you know how to fix it.

## Building the Habit

Great players check their positions constantly. They video every practice session. They know what good feels like and what it looks like.

Build this habit:

1. **Film every practice session** using your phone
2. **Check at least one checkpoint** each time you practice
3. **Save reference videos** of your best swings
4. **Track improvements** over time

The gap between what you feel and what's real is usually bigger than you think. Video closes that gap. Position checkpoints give you targets.

Your best swing is already in you. You just need to find and repeat the positions that produce it.
