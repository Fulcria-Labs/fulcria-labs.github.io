![How to Fix a Golf Slice in 5 Minutes (No Lesson Required)](/assets/images/fix-golf-slice.png)
If you've ever watched your ball curve violently to the right (or left, for lefties) and disappear into the trees, you know the frustration of the golf slice. It's the most common problem in amateur golf, affecting roughly 70% of recreational players.

The good news? A slice isn't some mysterious curse. It has specific, fixable causes. Here's how to diagnose and fix yours without booking a $100 lesson.

## Why Your Ball is Slicing

A slice happens when the clubface is open relative to your swing path at impact. In plain English: you're hitting the ball with the face pointing right of where your club is traveling.

The result is sidespin that curves the ball away from the target.

**Common causes:**

1. **Weak grip** - Hands rotated too far left on the club ([learn more about grip types](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/02/golf-grip-guide.html))
2. **Outside-in swing path** - Coming "over the top"
3. **Open clubface at impact** - Often from early release
4. **Ball position too far forward** - Promotes an open face ([setup fundamentals](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/13/golf-setup-stance.html))

## The 5-Minute Fix

### Step 1: Check Your Grip (30 seconds)

Look down at your left hand (for righties). Can you see 2-3 knuckles? If not, rotate your hand clockwise slightly. This "stronger" grip naturally closes the clubface.

### Step 2: Setup Square (30 seconds)

Put a club on the ground pointing at your target. Now set your feet, hips, and shoulders parallel to it. Many slicers unknowingly aim left, which forces an outside-in swing. For a complete breakdown of proper alignment, see our [golf setup and stance guide](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/13/golf-setup-stance.html).

### Step 3: Feel the Inside Path (2 minutes)

Place a headcover just outside your ball. Swing without hitting it. This forces an inside-out path, the opposite of a slice swing.

Practice 10 swings, exaggerating the inside path until it feels natural.

### Step 4: Close the Face Early (2 minutes)

Before your swing, rotate the clubface so it points slightly left of target at address. This pre-sets a more closed face through impact.

Hit 10 balls with this adjustment. Your shots might start left initially - that's okay. You're overcorrecting, and the truth is in the middle.

## How to Know If It's Working

The best way to track your progress is video. Film your swing from behind (down the target line) and check:

- Is your club coming from inside or outside?
- Is the clubface square at impact?

Modern AI swing analyzers can detect these issues automatically and give you instant feedback on what to fix next.

## When to Get Help

If your slice persists after 2-3 range sessions with these drills, consider getting a professional eye on your swing. A good instructor (or AI analysis tool) can spot issues you simply can't feel yourself.
