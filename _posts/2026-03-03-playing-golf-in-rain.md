# Playing Golf in the Rain: Tips to Keep Your Score Dry

Rain doesn't have to ruin your round. Some of the best golf I've played has been in light rain—fewer distractions, quieter course, and the ball actually sits up nicely in wet rough.

But playing well in the rain requires adjustments. Here's how to keep your swing and your scorecard from falling apart when the sky opens up.

## Grip Is Everything

When your grips get wet, your natural instinct is to squeeze harder. Don't. A death grip kills tempo and creates tension throughout your swing.

### The Rain Grip Solution

**Use a rain glove or go gloveless.** Synthetic rain gloves actually get grippier when wet—the opposite of leather gloves. If you don't have rain gloves, playing bare-handed can work surprisingly well. Your skin provides decent grip when wet, while a soaked leather glove is nearly useless.

**Carry extra towels.** Keep one dry towel tucked inside your bag and use the other for wiping down grips between shots. The few seconds spent drying your grip pays off in solid contact.

**Keep your grips tacky.** If you're playing wet conditions regularly, consider cord grips or multi-compound grips with more texture. Smooth grips are a liability in the rain.

## Stance and Balance Adjustments

Wet ground changes everything about your footing. Grass becomes slippery, and aggressive weight shifts can send you sliding.

### Stay Grounded

**Widen your stance slightly.** This lowers your center of gravity and improves stability on slick turf.

**Reduce lateral movement.** In dry conditions, you might shift weight aggressively through the ball. In the rain, dial that back. A more rotational swing with less slide keeps you from slipping.

**Check your spike cleanliness.** Mud caked in your spikes eliminates their purpose. Clear them out every few holes to maintain traction.

**Flatten your swing.** A steep angle of attack digs into wet turf and creates fat shots. A slightly shallower approach helps you sweep the ball cleanly.

## Club Selection Changes

The ball doesn't fly as far in the rain. Cold air is denser, rain adds resistance, and wet grass grabs the ball at impact.

### The 10% Rule

Plan for about 10% less distance in heavy rain. That 150-yard 7-iron becomes a 6-iron shot. Don't fight it—just accept the yardage loss and club up.

**Spin reduces dramatically.** Wet grooves can't grab the ball the same way. Expect less backspin on approach shots and plan for more roll-out. Land the ball shorter of your target.

**Fairway woods over long irons.** Hybrids and fairway woods are more forgiving from wet lies. The broader sole glides through damp turf instead of digging.

## Playing From Wet Lies

### Fairway Lies

The ball often sits slightly lower on wet grass. Don't try to help it up—trust your loft. Play the ball slightly back in your stance (half a ball width) and focus on making ball-first contact.

### Rough Lies

Wet rough is actually easier than dry rough. The moisture weighs down the grass, preventing it from wrapping around your hosel. Take your normal club and swing—the grass won't grab as much as you expect.

### Bunker Play

Wet sand is firmer and faster. Your wedge won't dig as deep, so adjust your technique:

- Open the face less than usual
- Enter the sand closer to the ball
- Expect a lower, faster-running shot

Wet bunkers can actually be easier once you understand the sand won't swallow your club.

## Mental Approach

Rain affects everyone on the course equally. If you stay patient while others get frustrated, you've gained an advantage.

### Accept the Conditions

Don't fight the weather. You're not going to shoot your best round ever—and that's fine. Adjust your expectations and focus on making smart plays.

### Slow Down Your Routine

Everything takes longer in the rain: gripping, aiming, setup. Build in extra time rather than rushing through your pre-shot routine.

### Stay Warm and Dry

Cold muscles don't perform. Layer appropriately, keep moving between shots, and use rain gear that allows a full shoulder turn. Restricted movement from bulky rain gear will cost you more strokes than the rain itself.

## Essential Rain Gear

- **Rain gloves** (synthetic, not leather)
- **Waterproof bag cover** (or a bag with built-in cover)
- **Multiple towels** (keep one bone-dry inside your bag)
- **Waterproof jacket** that doesn't restrict movement
- **Waterproof shoes** (obvious but critical)
- **Hat with a brim** to keep rain off your face

## Know When to Walk Off

Lightning is non-negotiable. If you see it or hear thunder, get off the course immediately. No round is worth the risk.

Heavy rain that eliminates visibility or makes the course unplayable isn't worth pushing through either. There's a difference between a challenging round in light rain and dangerous conditions.

## Practice in the Rain

If you get the chance, practice in wet conditions deliberately. Hit balls in light rain. Play nine holes when others stay home. The familiarity you build pays dividends when you're stuck playing an important round in bad weather.

Rain golf isn't ideal, but it's part of the game. Adapt your technique, adjust your expectations, and you might be surprised how well you can score when the weather turns.
