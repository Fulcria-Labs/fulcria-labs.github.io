A hook is one of the most frustrating shots in golf. That low, curving ball that starts right and violently curves left (for right-handed golfers) often ends up in trouble far worse than where you were aiming. Unlike a slice, which loses distance, a hook runs hot and often travels further into trouble.

The good news: hooks are usually caused by too much of a good thing. Understanding what creates the hook is the first step to fixing it.

## What Causes a Hook?

A hook occurs when the clubface is closed (pointing left) relative to the club's path at impact. The more closed the face relative to path, the more the ball curves left.

There are five main causes:

1. **Grip too strong** - Hands rotated too far to the right
2. **Overactive hands** - Flipping or rolling the wrists through impact
3. **Path too far inside-out** - Swing plane too shallow or flat
4. **Early release** - Casting the club and losing lag too early
5. **Poor weight transfer** - Hanging back instead of shifting forward

Let's address each one.

## Fix #1: Check Your Grip

A "strong" grip (hands rotated clockwise on the club) makes it easier to close the face through impact. While some players thrive with a stronger grip, too strong leads to hooks.

**The Test:**
Look down at your grip at address. Count how many knuckles you can see on your left hand (for right-handers). If you see 3 or 4 knuckles, your grip is too strong.

**The Fix:**
Rotate both hands slightly counterclockwise until you see only 2-2.5 knuckles on your left hand. The "V's" formed by your thumbs and forefingers should point toward your right shoulder, not your right ear.

**Drill - The Neutral Grip Check:**
1. Let your arms hang naturally at your sides
2. Notice how your palms face each other
3. Place them on the club maintaining this natural position
4. This is your neutral starting point

## Fix #2: Quiet Your Hands Through Impact

Hookers often have hyperactive hands that flip or roll through the hitting zone. While some hand rotation is natural, too much closes the face rapidly.

**The Test:**
Hit balls at half speed and freeze at impact. Check where the club face is pointing. If it's closed (pointing left of target), you're flipping.

**The Fix:**
Think "knuckles down" through impact. The back of your left hand should face the target at impact, not rotate over too quickly.

**Drill - The Pump Drill:**
1. Take the club back to waist height
2. Pump it down toward the ball 3 times
3. On the third pump, hit the ball
4. Feel how the hands stay quiet through impact

**Drill - Towel Under Arms:**
1. Place a towel under both armpits
2. Make half swings keeping the towel in place
3. This promotes a body-controlled swing rather than hand-dominated

## Fix #3: Fix Your Path

An excessively inside-out swing path (club approaching from inside the target line and exiting outside) makes it easier to hook. Combined with a closing face, this creates the dreaded snap hook.

**The Test:**
Place an alignment stick on the ground parallel to your target line. Place another stick about 6 inches outside the ball. If you consistently hit the outer stick on your downswing, you're too inside.

**The Fix:**
Feel like the club works more "up and around" rather than "flat and inside" on the backswing. On the downswing, feel like you're swinging toward right center field.

**Drill - Gate Drill:**
1. Set up two tees about 6 inches apart, just wider than your clubhead
2. Place them about 2 feet in front of the ball on your target line
3. Practice swinging through the gate
4. This promotes a straighter, more neutral path

## Fix #4: Maintain Your Lag

Early release (casting) causes the hands to pass the clubhead too early, resulting in a closed face at impact. Paradoxically, the player trying to "hit" the ball actually hooks it.

**The Test:**
Record your swing from face-on. At impact, check if the shaft is leaning forward (toward the target) or backward. If backward, you're casting.

**The Fix:**
Feel like you're pulling the grip end of the club through impact, not throwing the clubhead. The hands should lead the clubhead through the hitting zone.

**Drill - Preset Impact:**
1. Set up at address
2. Move into an impact position: hips open, hands ahead, weight on front foot
3. Take practice swings from this position
4. Ingrain the feeling of hands leading

**Drill - 9-to-3 Swings:**
1. Make swings from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock
2. Focus on keeping the face square through this zone
3. Hands should be slightly ahead of the clubhead at 6 o'clock (impact)

## Fix #5: Transfer Your Weight

Hanging back on the rear foot causes the club to pass the body too quickly, closing the face. Proper weight transfer keeps the body rotating ahead of the arms.

**The Test:**
After impact, check your finish position. If you're still on your back foot or falling backward, you're hanging back.

**The Fix:**
Feel your weight shift toward the target as you start the downswing. By impact, 80% of your weight should be on your front foot.

**Drill - Step Drill:**
1. Take your normal stance
2. On the downswing, step forward with your front foot as if walking toward the target
3. Hit the ball while stepping
4. This forces proper weight transfer

**Drill - Feet Together:**
1. Hit balls with your feet touching
2. You'll naturally shift weight properly to maintain balance
3. This promotes a body-controlled swing

## Quick Fixes on the Course

When the hook shows up mid-round, try these adjustments:

1. **Weaken your grip** - Rotate hands slightly left
2. **Stand closer to the ball** - Promotes an upright swing
3. **Play ball back slightly** - Gives less time for face to close
4. **Aim left** - Work with your curve temporarily
5. **Take less club and swing easier** - Aggressive swings promote hooks

## The Difference Between a Hook and a Draw

A draw is controlled; a hook is not. The draw curves 5-15 yards; a hook curves 20+ yards. If you can consistently hit a draw, you've fixed your hook and are using controlled face rotation to your advantage.

The goal isn't to eliminate all right-to-left curve. It's to control how much curve you produce.

## Practice Plan

**Week 1:** Focus on grip and hand position. Hit 50 balls daily with your new grip.

**Week 2:** Add the pump drill before each swing. Feel the quiet hands.

**Week 3:** Introduce the gate drill. Work on path awareness.

**Week 4:** Combine everything. Hit draws intentionally, controlling the curve.

## When to Seek Help

If you've tried these fixes consistently for 2-3 weeks without improvement, consider a lesson. A hook can also be caused by equipment issues:

- Clubs too flat (lie angle)
- Shaft too weak (causing excessive face rotation)
- Grips too small (promoting grip pressure changes)

A PGA professional can identify if your hook is technique-based or equipment-based.

## Summary

Fixing a hook requires understanding that you're doing something right (rotating the face) but too much of it. Address these five areas systematically:

1. Neutralize your grip
2. Quiet your hands through impact
3. Straighten your swing path
4. Maintain lag through impact
5. Transfer your weight forward

The hook can become a controlled draw - one of the most powerful shots in golf. With patience and the right drills, you'll turn that frustrating hook into a reliable, controlled ball flight.
