You take the club back and feel your body drift toward your back foot. On the downswing, you slide toward the target. The result? Fat shots, thin shots, and a frustrating lack of power despite feeling like you are swinging hard.

Swaying is one of the most common swing faults among amateur golfers. And the worst part is that most people do not even realize they are doing it.

This guide will show you exactly what swaying looks like, why it destroys your ball striking, and how to fix it with six drills you can practice today.

## What Is Swaying in the Golf Swing?

Swaying is excessive lateral movement of your lower body during the swing. Instead of rotating around your spine, your hips slide sideways.

In the backswing, this looks like your hips moving away from the target and your weight shifting to the outside of your trail foot. In the downswing, it looks like your hips sliding toward the target before or instead of rotating.

A proper swing involves rotation around a relatively stable center. Your hips turn, your shoulders coil, and energy builds through torque. Swaying replaces that efficient rotational movement with inefficient lateral motion.

The difference matters. A lot.

## Why Swaying Kills Your Golf Game

Swaying creates a chain reaction of problems that affect every part of your game.

### Inconsistent Contact

When you sway, your swing arc moves with you. The bottom of your swing shifts laterally, which means your low point is unpredictable. One swing you catch it thin. The next you chunk it fat. Even when you hit it solid, you cannot repeat it reliably.

Consistent ball striking requires a consistent low point. Swaying makes that nearly impossible.

### Loss of Power

Here is the counterintuitive truth: moving more does not create more power. Efficient energy transfer does.

When you rotate properly, you create torque between your upper and lower body. Your shoulders coil against stable hips, storing energy like a spring. When you unwind, that energy transfers to the ball.

When you sway, there is no coil. Your whole body moves together, leaving nothing to unwind. You might swing hard, but the ball goes nowhere.

### Poor Swing Path

Swaying often leads to an over-the-top move. When your hips slide toward the target in the downswing, your upper body has nowhere to go except out and around. This creates a steep, outside-in path that produces weak slices and pulls.

Even if you manage to shallow the club, the timing becomes impossibly difficult. You are fighting your body instead of working with it.

### Balance Problems

A swing built on lateral movement is inherently unstable. You will find yourself falling backward on your backswing or lunging forward through impact. Good balance and good ball striking go together. Swaying destroys both.

## How to Tell If You Are Swaying

Before you can fix the problem, you need to confirm you have it. Here are three ways to check.

### The Video Test

Record your swing from face-on (so the camera can see both your front and back). Draw a vertical line at the outside of your trail hip at address. During your backswing, does your hip move past that line? If so, you are swaying.

Do the same for your downswing. Draw a line at your lead hip. If it slides past that line before it rotates, you have a slide problem too.

### The Pressure Test

During your backswing, pay attention to where you feel pressure in your trail foot. It should be on the inside of your foot and up the inside of your thigh. If the pressure rolls to the outside of your foot, you are swaying.

### The Balance Test

Make a full backswing and hold. Can you lift your front foot off the ground without losing balance? If you are swaying, you will feel like you are falling backward when you try this.

## 6 Drills to Stop Swaying for Good

Now that you understand the problem, here are the solutions. These drills are ordered from simple awareness exercises to more advanced movement patterns.

### 1. The Wall Drill

This is the simplest way to feel the difference between swaying and rotating.

**How to do it:**

Stand with your trail hip about two inches from a wall. Take your setup position without a club. Make a backswing motion. If your trail hip touches the wall, you are swaying.

**The goal:** Turn your hips so your trail pocket moves toward the wall, but your hip joint stays off it. This is rotation without lateral movement.

Practice this for a few minutes each day until the rotational feeling becomes natural.

### 2. The Alignment Stick Barrier

This drill gives you immediate feedback on lateral movement.

**How to do it:**

Place an alignment stick vertically in the ground just outside your trail hip at address. It should be close enough that any lateral movement will cause you to bump it, but not so close that it interferes with a proper rotation.

Make slow swings, focusing on turning your hips rather than sliding them. If you touch the stick, you know you swayed.

**Progression:** Once you can make full swings without touching the stick, try the same drill with your lead hip on the downswing.

### 3. The Narrow Stance Drill

This drill makes swaying physically impossible, forcing you to rotate instead.

**How to do it:**

Address the ball with your feet almost touching. Make half swings, then progress to three-quarter swings. Because your base is so narrow, any lateral movement will cause you to lose balance.

You will naturally start rotating because it is the only way to make a swing from this position.

**When you return to your normal stance:** The rotational feeling should carry over. If you start swaying again, go back to narrow stance for a few swings.

### 4. The Jump Drill

This drill helps you feel proper weight loading in the backswing without lateral movement.

**How to do it:**

Take your address position. Make a backswing and stop at the top. From this position, try to jump straight up in the air.

If you have swayed, you will not be able to jump. Your weight is outside your trail foot, making you unbalanced. If you rotated properly, jumping straight up should feel easy.

**The cue:** Throughout your backswing, maintain the feeling that you could jump straight up at any moment.

### 5. The Arms Across Chest Drill

This drill isolates your hip and shoulder rotation from your arm swing, making it easier to feel proper movement.

**How to do it:**

Cross your arms over your chest with each hand on the opposite shoulder. Take your address posture. Now make a backswing motion using only your body rotation.

Focus on feeling your shoulders and hips turn around your spine. Without a club to manipulate, you will notice immediately if you are swaying instead of turning.

**Progress to a club:** Once the rotation feels natural, grab a club and try to replicate the same body movement.

### 6. The Ball Under Trail Foot Drill

This advanced drill creates instability that forces proper weight distribution.

**How to do it:**

Place a golf ball under the outside edge of your trail foot at address. Make swings with this setup. If you sway, you will feel the ball roll and you will lose balance.

To stay stable, you must keep your weight on the inside of your trail foot, which is exactly where it should be during a proper backswing.

**Start small:** Begin with half swings and work up to full swings as you develop stability.

## What Causes Swaying and How to Address the Root Issue

Knowing the drills is not enough. You also need to understand why you sway so you can address the underlying cause.

### Limited Hip Mobility

If your hips cannot rotate freely, your body finds another way to move. Often that means sliding laterally instead of turning.

**The fix:** Work on hip mobility exercises. Hip circles, 90/90 stretches, and deep squats can help increase your range of motion. Check out our [hip rotation guide](/blog/golf-hip-rotation-guide/) for specific exercises.

### Weak Core Muscles

Your core stabilizes your spine during the swing. If your core is weak, it cannot resist lateral forces, and you end up swaying.

**The fix:** Strengthen your core with exercises like planks, dead bugs, and rotational medicine ball throws. A stronger core helps you rotate around a stable center.

### Trying to Shift Weight Too Aggressively

Many golfers are told to shift their weight to their back foot in the backswing. They interpret this as sliding their whole body to the right.

**The fix:** Think about pressure rather than weight. Pressure into your trail foot increases through rotation, not lateral movement. Your weight should feel like it is loading the inside of your trail foot and glute, not rolling to the outside.

Our [weight transfer guide](/blog/golf-weight-transfer-guide/) covers this in depth.

### Ball Position Issues

If the ball is too far forward in your stance, you might sway back to get behind it.

**The fix:** Check your ball position. For most irons, the ball should be center or slightly forward of center. Driver should be opposite your lead heel. Getting this right removes the need to sway to reach the ball.

## How to Use Video Analysis to Track Your Progress

Fixing a sway requires changing a movement pattern that probably feels normal to you. Video feedback makes the invisible visible.

Here is a simple process:

1. **Record your swing** from face-on before you start working on the fix
2. **Draw reference lines** at your hips to track lateral movement
3. **Practice your drills** for a week
4. **Record again** and compare

You should see less lateral movement and more rotational motion. If not, spend more time with the drills that address your specific issue.

This is exactly what AI swing analysis tools like Swing Analyzer do automatically. Upload a swing video and get instant feedback on lateral movement, rotation, and other swing characteristics. It takes the guesswork out of self-diagnosis and helps you practice with purpose.

## Putting It All Together: A Practice Plan

Here is a simple four-week plan to eliminate your sway.

**Week 1: Awareness**
- Record your swing and confirm you are swaying
- Practice the wall drill daily (5 minutes)
- Use the alignment stick barrier at the range

**Week 2: Feel the Difference**
- Arms across chest drill (5 minutes before range sessions)
- Narrow stance drill with half swings
- Focus on pressure staying inside your trail foot

**Week 3: Build the Pattern**
- Jump drill to verify proper loading
- Ball under trail foot drill for advanced stability
- Full swings with alignment stick barrier

**Week 4: Ingrain and Verify**
- Regular practice swings without props
- Record your swing again and compare to Week 1
- Play a round focused on feeling centered

## Common Mistakes When Fixing a Sway

Avoid these pitfalls as you work on your swing.

### Restricting All Movement

Some golfers overcorrect by keeping their lower body completely still. This is not the goal. Your hips should turn freely. They just should not slide.

### Expecting Immediate Results

Movement patterns take time to change. You might feel awkward at first, and your ball striking might temporarily get worse before it gets better. Trust the process.

### Practicing Without Feedback

You cannot feel what you cannot feel. Use video, alignment sticks, or a wall to give yourself objective feedback on whether you are actually improving.

## Build a Swing That Rotates

Swaying is a common fault, but it is fixable. The drills in this guide will help you replace lateral movement with efficient rotation.

The payoff is significant. Better contact, more power, and a swing you can repeat under pressure.

Start with the wall drill today. Record your swing this week. And if you want detailed feedback on your lateral movement and rotation, try Swing Analyzer. Our AI can spot a sway in seconds and show you exactly what to work on.

Your swing should turn, not slide. Now you know how to make that happen.
