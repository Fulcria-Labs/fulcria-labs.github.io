Your grips are the only point of contact between you and the club. Worn, slick, or wrong-sized grips cost you shots without you even knowing it. Here's everything you need to know about choosing the best golf grips in 2026.

## Quick Recommendations

| Grip | Best For | Price |
|------|----------|-------|
| Golf Pride MCC | All-around performance | $7-9/grip |
| Golf Pride Tour Velvet | Soft feel, value | $4-6/grip |
| SuperStroke S-Tech | Reduced taper, even pressure | $8-10/grip |
| Lamkin Crossline | Firm feedback, durability | $4-5/grip |
| IOMIC Sticky | Tacky feel, all weather | $12-15/grip |

## Best Overall: Golf Pride MCC

The Multi-Compound (MCC) is Golf Pride's flagship hybrid grip and the most popular grip on the PGA Tour. Rory McIlroy, among many others, has used MCC grips for years.

**What makes it great:**
- Cord upper section for traction with the lead hand
- Rubber lower section for feel and comfort
- Excellent moisture management
- Available in multiple colors and sizes

**Best version:** The MCC Plus4 simulates four extra wraps of tape on the lower hand, promoting lighter grip pressure and reduced tension. The Align version adds a raised ridge for consistent hand placement.

**Pricing:** ~$7-9 per grip, often available in 13-packs for full regrip sets.

## Best Budget: Golf Pride Tour Velvet

If Tour Velvet grips are good enough for Tiger Woods' entire career, they're good enough for recreational golfers. This classic rubber grip offers excellent feel at a lower price point.

**Features:**
- Soft, tacky rubber compound
- Surface pattern for traction
- Consistent feel across temperature ranges
- Wide size availability

**Pricing:** ~$4-6 per grip - the best value for quality grips.

## Best for Reduced Grip Pressure: SuperStroke S-Tech

SuperStroke, famous for their putter grips, has expanded successfully into full-swing grips. Jordan Spieth and Sergio Garcia both use S-Tech grips.

**What stands out:**
- Minimal taper promotes even hand pressure
- Cross Traction surface pattern
- Helps square the clubface naturally
- Excellent performance in all weather

**Consideration:** The Cross Comfort version wicks moisture well but can be difficult to install properly.

**Pricing:** ~$8-10 per grip.

## Best Cord Grip: Golf Pride Tour Velvet Cord

For players who prioritize traction above all else, especially in humid conditions, full-cord grips deliver unmatched grip security.

**Why cord grips:**
- Maximum traction in all conditions
- Firm feedback
- Durability (cord grips last longer)
- Preferred by better players who don't wear gloves

**Trade-off:** Cord grips are firmer and can cause more wear on golf gloves.

**Pricing:** ~$6-8 per grip.

## Best Premium: IOMIC Sticky

Japanese brand IOMIC makes grips with a unique elastomer compound that stays tacky in any weather. Expensive but beloved by those who try them.

**Features:**
- Exceptional tacky feel
- Weather-resistant compound
- Vibrant color options
- No break-in period needed

**Pricing:** ~$12-15 per grip - the premium option.

## Best for Arthritis/Hand Issues: Lamkin Sonar

Larger, softer grips reduce the pressure needed to maintain control. The Lamkin Sonar series offers excellent shock absorption.

**Benefits:**
- Soft compound reduces vibration
- Available in oversized (+1/8")
- Genesis material for all-weather performance
- Gentle on hands and joints

**Pricing:** ~$7-9 per grip.

## Grip Size Guide

Grip size affects your ability to release the club properly:

| Glove Size | Grip Size |
|------------|-----------|
| Small (Cadet) | Undersize |
| Medium | Standard |
| Medium-Large | Midsize |
| XL | Oversize |

**Signs your grips are wrong size:**
- Too small: Hands too active, tend to [hook](/blog/fix-golf-hook/)
- Too large: Hands not active enough, tend to [slice](/blog/fix-golf-slice/)

**Pro tip:** If you're between sizes, go slightly larger. Larger grips promote lighter [grip pressure](/blog/golf-grip-pressure-guide/).

## When to Replace Grips

Replace your grips:
- **Every 40 rounds** or once per year (whichever comes first)
- When they feel slick or hard
- When you see visible wear spots
- When you notice inconsistent shots without swing changes

Over 80% of PGA Tour players use Golf Pride grips, and most regrip multiple times per season. Recreational golfers often wait too long.

## DIY vs. Professional Installation

**DIY regripping:**
- Supplies: grip tape, solvent, vise, hook blade
- Cost: ~$20 one-time plus grip cost
- Time: 5-10 minutes per club once you learn

**Pro shop installation:**
- Cost: ~$3-5 per club plus grip cost
- Advantage: Guaranteed proper alignment

**Our recommendation:** Learn DIY if you experiment with grips or replace them frequently. Use a pro shop for your first set to learn proper technique.

## The Bottom Line

For most golfers, Golf Pride MCC or Tour Velvet grips deliver excellent performance at reasonable prices. The MCC Plus4 is worth the upgrade if you struggle with grip pressure or hand tension.

Whatever you choose, don't neglect your grips. Fresh grips are one of the cheapest ways to improve your consistency and confidence.
