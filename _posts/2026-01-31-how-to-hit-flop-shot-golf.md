The flop shot is the showstopper of golf's short game. When executed properly, the ball launches nearly vertical, floats through the air like a butterfly, and lands soft enough to stick on the dance floor. It's the shot that makes playing partners gasp and strangers stop to watch.

But here's the reality: the flop shot is also one of the riskiest shots in golf. Hit it wrong, and you'll either skull it across the green into the next zip code or chunk it three feet. Phil Mickelson has holed flop shots on national television. He's also bladed a few into oblivion.

This guide will teach you when to use the flop shot, how to execute it, and equally important, when to leave it in the bag.

## What Is a Flop Shot?

A flop shot is a high, soft shot typically played from tight lies around the green. Unlike a standard chip that runs out after landing, the flop shot climbs steeply, descends almost vertically, and stops quickly with minimal roll.

Think of it as the opposite of a bump-and-run. Where a [chip shot](/blog/chipping-made-simple/) uses the ground to control distance, the flop shot uses height and backspin.

The characteristics of a well-executed flop shot include:

- **High launch angle** (60+ degrees)
- **Soft landing** with minimal bounce
- **Quick stop** with little roll-out
- **Controlled trajectory** under pressure

Tour pros use flop shots when they need to carry a hazard and stop the ball quickly on a tight pin. Phil Mickelson built his legend on this shot, and it's sometimes called "a Phil" in his honor.

## When to Hit a Flop Shot

The flop shot is a specialty tool, not an everyday option. Use it when:

### Short-Sided to a Tight Pin

You've missed the green on the wrong side, and there's only 10-15 feet between you and the flag with a bunker in between. A standard chip would roll past the hole. You need height and stop.

### Over a Bunker or Hazard

The pin is just over a greenside bunker with little green to work with. You need to carry the sand and land soft. A [standard bunker technique](/blog/greenside-bunker-basics/) won't help here because you're not in the sand.

### Downhill Green Running Away

The green slopes away from you, and anything with roll will race past the hole. A flop can land soft and use the slope to feed toward the cup.

### Elevated Green Edge

You need to get the ball up quickly to reach a green that sits above your ball position.

## The Setup: Building Your Launch Pad

The flop shot setup differs dramatically from a standard chip. Every element creates loft and encourages the club to slide under the ball.

### Open the Clubface First

This is critical and often done incorrectly. Open the clubface BEFORE you grip the club, not after.

When you open the face first, then take your grip, the face stays open through the swing naturally. If you grip first, then rotate the handle, the face will close back to square during your swing.

Open the face until it's nearly pointing at the sky. With a 60-degree wedge, this might mean 75-80 degrees of effective loft.

### Open Your Stance

Align your feet 20-30 degrees left of the target (for right-handers). Your swing will follow your body line, but the open face sends the ball toward the target.

This open stance also creates room for your arms to swing through without getting blocked by your body.

### Ball Position Forward

Play the ball forward of center, roughly off your front instep. This promotes the shallow, ascending contact needed to slide under the ball without digging.

### Weight Distribution

Here's where flop shots differ from standard chips. While a normal chip wants weight forward, the flop shot can handle a more neutral distribution, around 50/50 or even slightly favoring the back foot.

Why? Forward weight promotes a descending strike. For flop shots, you want to skim the surface, using the bounce of the club rather than driving down into the turf.

### Lower Your Hands

At address, drop your hands lower than normal. This exposes more of the club's bounce, which prevents the leading edge from digging. Phil Mickelson emphasizes this point: "Lay that club flat, and feel like you're trying to drive the back of the toe into the ground."

## The Swing: Commit and Accelerate

The flop shot swing requires commitment. Half-hearted attempts end in disaster.

### Make a Wide Takeaway

Swing the club back along your foot line (which is open to the target) with minimal wrist hinge initially. Width in the takeaway creates the sweeping motion needed for the flop.

Think of drawing a wide arc around your body rather than lifting the club steeply.

### Hinge at the Top

While the takeaway is wide, you do need [wrist hinge](/blog/golf-wrist-hinge-guide/) as you approach the top of your backswing. This creates the leverage to accelerate through impact.

For a standard flop around the green, a three-quarter backswing provides enough power without excessive risk.

### Accelerate Through Impact

Here's the make-or-break moment. You MUST accelerate the clubhead through the ball. Deceleration is the primary cause of flop shot disasters.

Phil Mickelson's key insight: "When I'm hitting a flop shot, I'm basically just trying to drive the club into the ground. I'm going to lay that club flat, and feel like I'm trying to drive the back of the toe into the ground."

The bounce of your wedge does the work. By keeping the face open and accelerating through, the bounce slides under the ball while the loft sends it skyward.

### Keep the Face Open Through Impact

Unlike a standard shot where the face rotates closed, the flop shot maintains an open face through the hitting zone. Feel like the clubface points toward the sky even after impact.

Think of the face holding a glass of water. If you can keep the water in the glass through impact and into the follow-through, you've kept the face open.

### High Finish

Follow through to a full finish with the club high. This ensures you accelerated through the shot and didn't quit on it.

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: Decelerating Through Impact

**The Problem**: Fear causes you to slow down at the ball, leading to fat shots or bladed skulls.

**The Fix**: Commit to a shorter backswing with full acceleration through. It's better to hit a flop shot 5 yards too far than to chunk it. As Phil says, "If you stop your arms and flip, the leading edge comes up and that's when you blade it."

### Mistake 2: Closing the Clubface

**The Problem**: The face rotates closed through impact, removing the loft you need and sending the ball low and left.

**The Fix**: Practice the "hold the face open" feel. After impact, the toe should point skyward. Also, make sure you opened the face BEFORE gripping the club.

### Mistake 3: Poor Lie Selection

**The Problem**: Attempting flop shots from tight lies without enough grass under the ball.

**The Fix**: The flop shot needs a decent lie. Some cushion under the ball helps the club slide through. From a truly tight, hardpan lie, the safer play is usually a [bump-and-run](/blog/chipping-made-simple/) to a larger portion of the green.

### Mistake 4: Playing the Ball Too Far Back

**The Problem**: Ball position in the middle or back of your stance creates a steep, digging attack angle.

**The Fix**: Move the ball forward, off your front instep. This promotes the shallow approach the flop requires.

### Mistake 5: Too Much Tension

**The Problem**: Gripping tightly out of fear, which restricts the natural motion needed.

**The Fix**: Light grip pressure, maybe 4 out of 10. The flop shot needs soft hands and a fluid motion. Tension creates jerky swings and missed hits.

## Practice Drills for Flop Shot Mastery

### Drill 1: The Soft Landing Drill

**Setup**: Place a towel on the practice green 10-15 yards away.

**Goal**: Hit flop shots that land on the towel and stay on it (or very close).

**Purpose**: This drill teaches you to control trajectory and landing softness. If the ball bounces off the towel, you haven't generated enough height and spin.

Start close and gradually increase distance as your technique improves.

### Drill 2: The Behind-the-Ball Towel Drill

**Setup**: Place a towel 2 inches behind the ball.

**Goal**: Hit the ball without disturbing the towel.

**Purpose**: This trains the shallow, skimming contact the flop shot requires. If you hit the towel, you're coming in too steep.

This drill builds confidence that you can slide under the ball without chunking it.

### Drill 3: The Height Control Ladder

**Setup**: Create three zones at 10, 15, and 20 yards.

**Goal**: Hit all three distances with the same high trajectory by adjusting swing length only.

**Purpose**: Distance control with flop shots comes from swing length, not swing speed. This drill teaches you to calibrate different distances while maintaining technique.

### Drill 4: One-Handed Flops

**Setup**: Hit flop shots with just your lead hand on the club.

**Goal**: Successful contact with the ball launching high.

**Purpose**: This drill removes the tendency to flip with your trail hand. It also builds the feel for using the bounce and keeping the face open.

Start with small swings and work up gradually.

### Drill 5: High Finish Freeze

**Setup**: Hit flop shots and freeze your finish position for 3 seconds.

**Goal**: Finish with the clubface still open and pointing upward.

**Purpose**: The freeze confirms you accelerated through and maintained an open face. If you're decelerating, you won't be able to hold a balanced finish.

## When NOT to Hit a Flop Shot

Smart [course management](/blog/golf-course-management-strategy/) means knowing when the flop shot isn't the right play. Consider alternatives when:

### You Have Green to Work With

If there's 30+ feet between you and the hole with no obstacles, a standard chip or pitch is higher percentage. The flop shot introduces unnecessary risk when simpler options exist.

### The Lie Is Questionable

Tight lies, hardpan, or sitting-down lies make clean flop contact difficult. The margin for error shrinks dramatically. Choose a safer shot that the lie supports.

### You Haven't Practiced It

This sounds obvious, but it matters. The flop shot requires specific technique and confidence. If you haven't practiced it recently, the pressure of the course isn't the place to experiment. Take your medicine with a safer shot and live to fight another hole.

### Wind Is a Factor

High, soft shots are wind magnets. A strong gust can move your flop shot 10+ yards offline or alter its descent dramatically. In windy conditions, lower shots are more predictable.

### The Consequences of Failure Are Severe

Short-sided to a bunker? Flop shot makes sense. Short-sided to water? Think twice. The risk-reward calculus changes when the penalty for failure is a stroke and distance rather than just a difficult next shot.

## The Risk-Reward Reality

The flop shot looks spectacular when it works. But statistics don't favor it for most recreational golfers.

Tour pros practice this shot daily and still choose safer options whenever possible. Phil Mickelson attempts high-risk flops because he's spent decades perfecting the technique and has extraordinary touch.

For most situations, the better approach is:

1. **First choice**: Can you putt it? Use your putter from the fringe whenever possible.
2. **Second choice**: Can you chip it? A standard chip with roll-out is higher percentage than a flop.
3. **Third choice**: Do you need the flop? Only use it when options 1 and 2 truly won't work.

That said, there are situations where the flop shot IS the right play. Learning the technique expands your short game options and gives you a tool for those moments when nothing else works.

## Put Your Flop Shot to the Test

Want to see if your technique holds up? Recording your flop shot practice reveals issues you can't feel. Common problems visible on video include:

- Face closing before impact
- Steep attack angle instead of shallow
- Deceleration through the hitting zone
- Ball position errors
