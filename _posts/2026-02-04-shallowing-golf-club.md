If you've watched any YouTube golf content recently, you've probably heard instructors yelling "shallow it!" or praising players for a "shallow move." But what does shallowing actually mean, and why does everyone seem obsessed with it?

## What Is Shallowing?

Shallowing refers to how the club transitions from backswing to downswing. Specifically, it's when the club drops to a flatter, more horizontal plane at the start of the downswing.

The opposite is "steepening" - when the club moves to a more vertical plane and approaches the ball from an outside path. This is the dreaded "over the top" move.

**Visual:** Imagine a clock face behind you. A steep downswing has the club moving from 11 to 5. A shallow downswing moves from 4 to 10.

## Why Shallowing Helps Your Game

### 1. Promotes Inside-Out Path

A shallowed club naturally approaches the ball from inside the target line, promoting a draw or straight ball flight rather than a [slice](/golf/swing-tips/2026/01/30/fix-golf-slice.html).

### 2. Uses Ground Force

Shallowing is part of proper sequencing where the lower body leads. This generates power from the ground up rather than relying on arm strength. See our guides on [weight transfer](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/12/golf-weight-transfer.html) and [hip rotation](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/10/golf-hip-rotation.html).

### 3. Creates Better Contact

With a shallower approach angle, there's a longer "flat spot" at the bottom of the swing. This gives you more margin for error - you're not as dependent on perfect timing.

### 4. Matches What Tour Pros Do

Nearly every professional golfer shallows in transition. It's not a stylistic choice - it's a fundamental of efficient mechanics.

## The Over-the-Top Problem

When you don't shallow (or you steepen), the club comes down outside the intended path. To avoid a massive slice, your body compensates by opening up early, which opens the clubface.

The result is one of two misses:

- **Pull-slice** (starts left, curves right)
- **Pull-hook** (starts left, goes more left)

Both are inconsistent and lose distance.

## How to Feel the Shallow Move

### Drill 1: The Headcover Under Arm

Place a headcover under your trail armpit at setup. Make swings keeping it there through impact. This forces your trail elbow to drop down rather than away from your body.

### Drill 2: Pause at Top

Make your backswing, pause for a full second at the top, then start the downswing by feeling like you drop your hands straight down. The arms should feel passive in transition.

### Drill 3: The Wall Drill

Stand with your rear end against a wall. Make a backswing, then try to start your downswing with your hips moving toward the target while keeping your rear end against the wall. This separates lower body and upper body.

## Common Mistakes When Trying to Shallow

| Mistake | What Happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Rolling the wrists | Hooks or blocks | Keep wrists quiet, drop with gravity |
| Swaying instead of rotating | Power loss | Rotate hips, don't slide |
| Overdoing it | Thin shots, blocks right | Some steepness needed for compression |

## The Best Way to Check Your Transition

Film your swing from behind (down the line view). Draw a line along your shaft at the top of the backswing. Where does the club go in the first move down?

- **Above the line** = steepening (over the top)
- **On the line** = maintaining (neutral)
- **Below the line** = shallowing (good)

AI swing analyzers can detect this automatically and show you frame-by-frame where your transition goes wrong.
