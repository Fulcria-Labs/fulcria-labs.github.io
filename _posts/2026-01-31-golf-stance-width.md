Your stance width affects everything in your golf swing—balance, rotation, power, and consistency. Too wide and you'll restrict your turn. Too narrow and you'll lose stability. Yet most golfers never give their stance width a second thought.

This guide breaks down the optimal stance width for every club in your bag, common mistakes to avoid, and simple tests to find your personal sweet spot.

## Why Stance Width Matters

Before diving into specifics, understand what stance width influences:

- **Balance**: Too narrow and you'll sway. Too wide and you'll slide.
- **Hip rotation**: A wider stance restricts how much your hips can turn.
- **Weight transfer**: Proper width enables natural weight shift.
- **Power generation**: The right width lets you coil and release efficiently.

The goal isn't a one-size-fits-all answer—it's finding the width that lets *you* swing in balance while maximizing rotation.

## Stance Width by Club

Here's a framework to start from, then adjust based on your body and swing:

### Driver: Shoulder Width + 2-3 Inches

Your widest stance should be with the driver. Why? You need the most stability for your longest, fastest swing.

**How to measure**: Stand with your feet together, then step out until the *insides* of your feet align with the *outsides* of your shoulders, plus a couple inches.

**Common mistake**: Going too wide. Many golfers think wider = more power, but excessive width restricts hip turn and actually costs you distance.

For more driver tips, see our [complete driver guide](/blog/golf-driver-tips/).

### Fairway Woods and Hybrids: Shoulder Width

Step in slightly from your driver stance. The inside of your feet should roughly align with the outside of your shoulders.

This width provides enough stability for these longer clubs while allowing slightly more rotation than driver.

### Long Irons (3-5): Just Under Shoulder Width

As clubs get shorter, your stance narrows progressively. For long irons, the insides of your feet should be just inside shoulder width.

### Mid Irons (6-8): Slightly Narrower Than Shoulder Width

Continue narrowing. You're making more controlled swings with less overall speed, so you need less foundation width.

### Short Irons (9-PW): Hip Width

For scoring clubs, narrow to approximately hip width. The inside of each foot aligns roughly with the outside of each hip.

This narrower stance promotes a steeper swing plane and cleaner contact—exactly what you want for approach shots.

### Wedges: Hip Width or Narrower

For pitch shots, chips, and bunker shots, your stance can be hip width or even narrower. Some players like a slightly open stance for wedges, which naturally narrows the effective width.

## The Simple Width Test

Not sure if your stance is right? Try this quick test at the range:

1. **Set up normally** for a mid-iron (7-iron works well)
2. **Make a full swing** at about 80% effort
3. **Hold your finish** for 3 seconds

**What to look for:**

- If you're falling forward or backward, your stance is likely too narrow
- If you can't fully rotate through to a balanced finish, your stance is likely too wide
- If you finish balanced with your belt buckle facing the target, you've found a good width

Repeat with driver and wedges, adjusting until you can consistently finish in balance.

## Common Stance Width Mistakes

### 1. Same Width for Every Club

Many golfers use one stance width for everything. This restricts rotation with short irons and reduces stability with woods.

**Fix**: Consciously widen for driver, narrow for wedges, and scale between them for other clubs.

### 2. Too Wide with Irons

Influenced by driver swings, some players spread too wide with irons. This blocks hip rotation and often leads to fat or thin shots.

**Fix**: The narrower stance for irons should feel almost uncomfortable at first. Trust that less width means better rotation and cleaner contact.

### 3. Inconsistent Width

Without a system, golfers often vary their stance randomly. One swing might be narrow, the next wide.

**Fix**: Build a pre-shot routine that includes specific foot placement. Use [alignment sticks](/blog/golf-alignment-aim/) to train consistency.

## How to Find Your Optimal Width

Everyone's body is different. Here are three tests to personalize your stance:

### The Jump Test

1. Jump in the air and land naturally
2. Look at where your feet land
3. This approximates your body's natural athletic base

Use this as your mid-iron stance, then adjust wider/narrower for other clubs.

### The Rotation Test

1. Set up in your normal stance
2. Without a club, rotate your hips as far as possible
3. If rotation feels blocked, narrow your stance
4. If you feel unstable, widen slightly

### The Balance Test

1. Set up with a mid-iron
2. Have someone gently push your shoulders (front, back, sides)
3. If you stumble easily, adjust width until you're stable from all directions

## Practice Drills for Stance Consistency

### Drill 1: Alignment Stick Gate

Place two alignment sticks on the ground parallel to your target line, the correct width apart for the club you're hitting. Step into this "gate" for every shot until proper width becomes automatic.

### Drill 2: Feet Together Progression

Start with feet together and hit balls. Gradually widen your stance one shot at a time until you find the width that produces the best balance and contact. This builds awareness of how width affects your swing.

### Drill 3: Balance Hold

Hit shots and hold your finish for a full 5 seconds. Only move to the next ball if you maintained perfect balance. If you can't hold the finish, adjust your width.

## Stance Width and Ball Position

Width and ball position work together. In general:

- **Wider stance** = ball more forward (driver)
- **Narrower stance** = ball more centered (wedges)

For a complete guide to ball position, see our [ball position guide](/blog/golf-ball-position-guide/).

## Using Video to Verify Your Stance

One of the best ways to check your stance width is recording your swing from face-on view. You can clearly see:

- Whether your feet are properly aligned with your shoulders
- If you're staying balanced through the swing
- How your width compares between clubs

[Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) makes this easy—record your swing, and you'll see exactly where your feet are positioned relative to your body. It takes the guesswork out of stance setup.

## Quick Reference

| Club | Stance Width |
|------|--------------|
| Driver | Shoulder width + 2-3" |
| Fairway woods | Shoulder width |
| Long irons | Just under shoulder width |
| Mid irons | Slightly narrower than shoulders |
| Short irons | Hip width |
| Wedges | Hip width or narrower |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Width varies by club**—wider for driver, narrower for wedges
2. **Balance is the test**—if you can't hold your finish, adjust width
3. **Build it into your routine**—consistent width leads to consistent shots
4. **Use video** to verify your setup matches what you think you're doing

Your stance width might seem like a minor detail, but it's the foundation of every swing. Get it right, and everything else becomes easier.
