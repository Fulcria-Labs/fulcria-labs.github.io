The bump and run might be the most underrated shot in golf. While flashy flop shots get all the attention on social media, the humble bump and run is what actually saves strokes on your scorecard.

Here is the truth: tour pros use the bump and run far more often than the high-lofted chips amateurs attempt. Why? Because it works. The margin for error is huge, the technique is simple, and the results are predictable. Once you master this shot, you will wonder why you ever reached for your lob wedge around the greens.

This guide covers everything you need to know. From understanding when to use it, to the proper setup and technique, to club selection and practice drills that build real skill. By the end, you will have a reliable go-to shot for most greenside situations.

## What Is a Bump and Run?

A bump and run is a low chip shot that spends more time rolling on the ground than flying through the air. You "bump" the ball onto the green with minimal trajectory, then let it "run" toward the hole like a putt.

Think of it as the hybrid between a chip and a putt. You are using a putting-like motion with a lofted club, producing a shot that pops up just enough to clear the fringe before rolling out.

The name describes exactly what happens: the ball bumps onto the putting surface, then runs the rest of the way. Simple. Effective. Repeatable.

When most golfers picture a "chip shot," they are actually thinking of a bump and run. It is the most commonly used greenside shot in the game, and for good reason.

## When to Use the Bump and Run

The bump and run is your default option around the green. Use it whenever you can, and only choose a higher shot when obstacles demand it.

### Perfect Situations for the Bump and Run

**No obstacles between you and the hole.** If there is nothing but green between your ball and the pin, the bump and run is almost always the right choice. Less air time means less chance for error.

**Firm, fast greens.** When greens are running quick, a high chip will release too much. The bump and run lands soft and rolls predictably with the contours.

**Tight lies.** When your ball sits on hardpan or closely mowed turf, you need the simplest possible motion. The bump and run delivers.

**Windy conditions.** A low runner is barely affected by wind. A high chip can get knocked off line or pushed past the hole.

**Links-style courses.** These courses were designed for the bump and run. Firm turf, open fronts to greens, and minimal rough around the putting surfaces all reward this shot.

**When you lack confidence.** If you are nervous over a chip, go with the bump and run. It removes variables and gives you the highest probability of a decent result.

### When to Choose a Different Shot

**Bunker or hazard in the way.** If you need to carry an obstacle, the bump and run will not work. Time for a pitch or lob shot.

**Elevated green.** When the green sits above you with a steep face, you need height to get the ball up and stopping.

**Downhill to the hole with no green to work with.** Sometimes you are short-sided and need a high, soft-landing shot. These situations are rare, but they exist.

**Deep rough around the ball.** If your ball is sitting down in thick grass, you may need more loft to pop it out.

The golden rule: play the bump and run whenever possible. Only add height when the situation absolutely requires it.

## The Setup: Foundation for a Great Bump and Run

Your setup pre-programs the shot. Get this right, and the swing almost takes care of itself.

### Narrow Your Stance

Bring your feet closer together than a full swing. They should be roughly underneath your hips, similar to your putting stance. This narrower base centers your head directly over the ball and limits unnecessary body movement.

A narrow stance also promotes the small, controlled motion this shot requires. You are not generating power here. You are creating precision.

### Weight Forward

Before you swing, shift 60 to 70 percent of your weight onto your front foot. This is non-negotiable.

Once you are there, stay there. Many golfers shift forward at address, then drift back during the swing. Fight this urge. Keeping your weight forward throughout promotes the downward strike that catches the ball cleanly.

Think of it like this: your front leg is a post. Everything rotates around that post.

### Ball Position Back

Play the ball back of center in your stance, somewhere between the middle and your trail foot. The exact position depends on how much roll you want.

Ball farther back equals lower flight and more roll. Ball closer to center equals slightly higher launch with moderate roll. Start with the ball off your back heel and adjust from there based on results.

### Hands Ahead of the Ball

At address, your hands should be positioned ahead of the ball, closer to your front thigh. This setup naturally delofts the club and ensures you strike down on the ball at impact.

Look down at your shaft. It should be leaning toward the target, not vertical or leaning away. This forward shaft lean is the key to crisp contact.

### Light Grip Pressure

Hold the club like you are holding a small bird. Firm enough that it will not fly away, but gentle enough that you will not hurt it. On a scale of 1 to 10, aim for about a 4.

Tension in your hands travels up your arms and into your shoulders. Loose grip pressure keeps the motion fluid and promotes better touch.

## The Technique: Simple and Repeatable

The bump and run swing is purposely minimal. You are removing variables, not adding them.

### Use Your Shoulders, Not Your Wrists

This is the single most important technical key. Keep your wrists quiet throughout the entire motion.

Most amateurs use too much wrist action when chipping. They flip at the ball, trying to scoop it into the air. The result is fat shots, thin shots, and zero consistency.

Instead, power the swing with your shoulders. Think of it as a big putting stroke. Your arms and shoulders move together as a unit. Your wrists stay firm and passive.

Create a lowercase "y" shape with your arms and the club shaft. Maintain that "y" from start to finish. No hinge on the backswing. No flip through impact. Just a smooth rocking of the shoulders.

### Keep Your Head Still

Your head position controls your contact point. If your head moves, the bottom of your swing moves with it.

Stay focused on the back of the ball. Keep your head down and your eyes fixed until after the ball is gone. Let your ears tell you where it went.

A useful checkpoint: try to see the ground where the ball was after you strike it. If you can see that spot, you kept your head still.

### Rock Back and Through

The motion should feel like a pendulum. Equal and smooth in both directions.

Take the club back with your shoulders, keeping your lower body quiet. Feel your weight stay forward on your front foot. Then rock through, letting the club sweep the ball off the turf.

The throughswing should mirror the backswing. If you take the club back to 8 o'clock, finish at 4 o'clock. This creates consistent speed and predictable distance.

### Brush the Grass

You are not digging into the turf. You are brushing it.

Feel the clubhead sweep along the ground through impact, taking the tiniest amount of grass after the ball. The divot, if any, should be shallow and start after where the ball was sitting.

If you are chunking shots, you are probably trying to hit down too steeply. If you are blading them, you are likely pulling up through impact. The sweet spot is a shallow, sweeping motion that catches ball first, then turf.

## Club Selection: Matching the Club to the Shot

One of the biggest short game mistakes is always grabbing the same club around the green. Usually a sand wedge or lob wedge, regardless of the situation.

For bump and runs, you want less loft, not more.

### The 7-Iron or 8-Iron

These are your bump and run workhorses. The low loft produces a shot that pops up just enough to clear the fringe, then rolls like a putt.

**Best for:** Long runs to the hole, firm greens, minimal obstacles.

**Air-to-roll ratio:** Approximately 1:3 or 1:4. The ball flies one quarter of the distance and rolls three quarters.

### The 9-Iron or Pitching Wedge

A versatile middle ground when you need slightly more carry or a gentler landing.

**Best for:** Medium distances, moderate roll required, slightly higher fringe to carry.

**Air-to-roll ratio:** Approximately 1:2. Half carry, half roll.

### The Hybrid or Fairway Wood

Many golfers are surprised by this option, but hybrids make excellent bump and run clubs. The low loft and wide sole glide through turf easily.

**Best for:** From tight lies or hardpan where a thin swing might skull an iron. Also useful when you want maximum roll.

### The Putter from Off the Green

When conditions allow, the putter is the safest option. No need to even execute a chip motion.

**Best for:** Short fringe, flat ground between you and the hole, firm conditions.

### How to Choose

Follow this simple rule: use the least loft that gets the ball on the green. Then let the ball roll to the hole.

Survey the shot. Where is your ideal landing spot? How much green do you have to work with? Pick the club that lands the ball just on the putting surface and lets it release the rest of the way.

When in doubt, go with less loft. A bump and run that runs past the hole is almost always closer than a flop shot that comes up short or blades over the green.

## Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

Even this simple shot has pitfalls. Here are the errors I see most often and how to correct them.

### Mistake 1: Using Too Much Power

The bump and run is about finesse, not force. Many golfers swing too hard, sending the ball racing across the green.

**The fix:** Shorten your backswing and match the swing length to the distance. For a 10-yard chip, you barely move the club back. For a 30-yard chip, your hands might reach waist height. Let swing length control distance, not swing speed.

### Mistake 2: Flipping Your Wrists

Trying to help the ball up by flicking your wrists through impact is the most destructive habit in chipping. It leads to fat and thin contact, unpredictable distances, and zero confidence.

**The fix:** Practice with an alignment stick pressed against your lead forearm and gripped in your hands. If the stick separates from your forearm during the swing, your wrists are breaking down. Train until you maintain that connection through impact.

### Mistake 3: Ball Position Too Far Back

Playing the ball off your back toe can work, but overdoing it leads to shots that never get airborne. The club digs into the ground and produces a low, skulled runner.

**The fix:** Start with the ball one ball-width back of center. This is far enough back to promote clean contact but not so far that you deloft the club excessively.

### Mistake 4: Aiming at the Hole

Your target is not the flagstick. It is your landing spot on the green.

**The fix:** Pick a specific point where you want the ball to land. An old divot, a discolored patch of grass, anything you can aim at. Focus on landing the ball there, and let physics handle the roll.

### Mistake 5: Decelerating Through Impact

Fear of going too far causes golfers to slow down at impact. This produces fat chunks and unpredictable contact.

**The fix:** Commit to acceleration. A shorter backswing with committed acceleration beats a long backswing with a tentative finish every time. Make your mantra "short back, accelerate through."

### Mistake 6: Looking Up Too Early

The urge to watch your shot is strong. But lifting your head before contact changes your spine angle and moves the low point of your swing.

**The fix:** Keep your eyes on the ball until after impact. Listen for the ball to land before looking up. Or pick a specific dimple on the ball and watch yourself hit that dimple.

## Practice Drills That Build Real Skill

Reading about technique is one thing. Building the feel takes repetition with purpose. Here are four drills that work.

### Drill 1: The Air-to-Roll Ratio Test

This drill teaches you exactly how each club behaves, so you can pick the right one on the course.

**Setup:** Find a spot just off the practice green. Place a marker at the halfway point between you and the hole.

**Execution:** Hit bump and runs with your 7-iron, 9-iron, and pitching wedge. Note where each shot lands relative to the halfway marker and how far it rolls out.

**Goal:** Build a mental chart of each club's ratio. You might find your 7-iron flies 25 percent and rolls 75 percent, while your pitching wedge splits 40/60. This knowledge is gold on the course.

### Drill 2: The Gate Drill

This drill grooves a consistent path and promotes solid contact.

**Setup:** Place two tees in the ground, slightly wider than your clubhead, about two inches behind the ball.

**Execution:** Hit chips without touching either tee. This forces you to swing straight back and through, eliminating the casting or looping that causes thin and fat shots.

**Goal:** Ten consecutive chips without touching the tees.

### Drill 3: The Ladder

This drill builds distance control, the real key to getting up and down.

**Setup:** Place five targets on the practice green at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 feet from the fringe.

**Execution:** Starting with the closest target, bump and run to each one in order. If you land inside three feet of the target, move to the next distance. Miss? Start over from the beginning.

**Goal:** Complete the ladder from first target to last without missing. Track how many attempts it takes and try to improve over time.

### Drill 4: The One-Club Challenge

This drill forces you to manipulate trajectory and distance through technique rather than club selection.

**Setup:** Take only your 8-iron to the practice green.

**Execution:** Hit every chip with that one club. Low runners to far pins. Higher chips to close pins. Learn to adjust ball position, shaft lean, and swing length to create different shots with the same club.

**Goal:** Complete 9 holes of par-2 chipping (chip and putt from each spot) and see how close to 18 you can score using only one club.

## Putting It into Practice on the Course

Knowing the technique is not enough. You need a process for executing under pressure.

### Step 1: Read the Shot

Walk up to your ball and survey the situation. What is between you and the hole? How much green do you have to work with? Is the green sloped? Is it firm or soft?

### Step 2: Pick Your Landing Spot

Identify exactly where you want the ball to land. Not "on the green somewhere" but a specific spot the size of a dinner plate. A discolored patch, an old pitch mark, anything you can lock onto.

### Step 3: Choose Your Club

Based on your landing spot and the remaining distance to the hole, select the club that produces the right air-to-roll ratio. Remember: less loft when possible.

### Step 4: Make Your Practice Swing

Take one or two practice swings, focusing on the length of swing needed for this distance. Feel the brushing contact with the turf. Visualize the ball landing on your spot and rolling out.

### Step 5: Execute with Commitment

Address the ball, take one last look at your landing spot, and swing with full commitment. No hesitation. No steering. Trust your preparation and let the motion flow.

Hesitation is the enemy of good chipping. Once you have done your homework, the only thing left is to commit.
