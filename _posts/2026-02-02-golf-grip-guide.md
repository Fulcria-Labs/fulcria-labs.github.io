Your grip is the only connection between your body and the club. Yet most amateurs have never intentionally chosen their grip - they just grabbed the club however felt comfortable.

Here's why that matters, and how to find your optimal grip.

## The Three Grip Types

### Weak Grip

- Fewer than 2 knuckles visible on lead hand
- V's formed by thumb and forefinger point toward lead shoulder
- **Promotes:** Open clubface, fade/slice

### Neutral Grip

- 2 knuckles visible on lead hand
- V's point to trailing shoulder
- **Promotes:** Square face, neutral ball flight

### Strong Grip

- 3+ knuckles visible on lead hand
- V's point well right of trailing shoulder
- **Promotes:** Closed clubface, draw/hook

## There's No "Correct" Grip

Here's the secret: all three grips can work. Dustin Johnson uses a weak grip. Paul Azinger used an extremely strong grip. Both are major champions.

The key is matching your grip to your swing tendencies.

| Your Miss | Try This |
|-----------|----------|
| Slice | Stronger grip |
| Hook | Weaker grip |
| Inconsistent | Start neutral and adjust |

## The Grip Pressure Myth

You've probably heard "grip it like you're holding a bird" or "firm but not tight." These are terrible instructions.

Better guidance: your forearms shouldn't bulge with tension. Beyond that, grip pressure is personal. Some tour players grip firmly, others loosely.

## How Grip Affects Everything Else

Your grip sets up your entire swing:

- Strong grip = closed face at top = flatter swing plane
- Weak grip = open face at top = steeper swing plane

This is why grip changes feel so dramatic. You're not just changing hand position - you're changing your entire swing mechanics.

## Experimenting Safely

If you're considering a grip change:

1. Make the change on the range, not the course
2. Give it at least 50-100 balls before judging
3. Expect shots to go in unexpected directions initially
4. Film your swing to see the actual changes

AI analyzers can detect grip-related issues (open/closed face patterns) automatically and suggest whether a grip adjustment might help.
