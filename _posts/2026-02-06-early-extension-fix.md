If you've ever finished a round with a sore lower back, early extension might be the culprit. This common swing fault affects roughly 65% of amateur golfers, and it's one of the most damaging patterns you can have.

The good news? It's fixable. Here's what you need to know.

## What Is Early Extension?

Early extension happens when your hips thrust toward the ball during the downswing instead of rotating around. Your pelvis moves closer to the ball at impact than it was at address.

**The result:** Your spine has to hyperextend (arch backward) to make room for your arms to swing through. This puts enormous stress on your lower back and creates inconsistent contact.

## Why It's a Problem

1. **Back pain** - The hyperextension compresses your lower spine repeatedly
2. **Inconsistent contact** - Moving your body toward the ball changes the swing arc
3. **Loss of power** - You're using your back, not your hips, to generate speed
4. **Blocks and hooks** - The swing path gets disrupted, causing wild misses

## What Causes Early Extension

Early extension is usually a compensation, not a root cause. Common triggers:

- **Limited hip mobility** - Tight hip flexors force you to thrust forward
- **Weak glutes** - Can't stabilize the pelvis during rotation
- **Wrong setup** - Standing too far from the ball
- **Overactive arms** - Using arms instead of body rotation

## 3 Drills to Fix It

### Drill 1: Wall Sit Rotations (2 minutes)

Stand with your back against a wall, knees bent like you're sitting in a chair. Make practice swings while keeping your glutes pressed against the wall throughout.

If you can't rotate without losing contact with the wall, that's where you need to work.

### Drill 2: The Chair Drill (3 minutes)

Place a chair or stool about 6 inches behind your rear end at address. Make swings where your butt stays in contact with the chair throughout the backswing AND downswing.

This trains the feeling of hip rotation without forward thrust.

### Drill 3: Medicine Ball Throws (5 minutes)

Hold a medicine ball or heavy pillow. Get in your golf stance and throw it to a partner or against a wall using only hip rotation, keeping your back straight.

This builds the hip rotation pattern without the complexity of the golf swing.

## The Quick Self-Test

Set up to an imaginary ball and have a friend (or your phone on a tripod) record from down the line. Check:

1. At address, note how far your belt buckle is from the ball
2. At impact, is it closer, the same, or farther?

If it's closer at impact, you have early extension.

## When to See a Pro

If you've tried these drills for a few weeks and the pattern persists, consider:

1. **TPI-certified instructor** - They specialize in swing-body connections
2. **Physical therapist** - Hip mobility might need professional intervention
3. **Video analysis** - Get objective feedback on your progress

Early extension is stubborn because it often feels powerful. The thrust toward the ball creates the illusion of effort. But efficient rotation will ultimately produce more speed with less pain.
