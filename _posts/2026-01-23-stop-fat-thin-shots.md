Nothing kills momentum like chunking one fat into the ground, then skulling the next one over the green. These shots feel completely different—but they share the same root cause.

**Fat and thin shots are two symptoms of one problem: inconsistent low point control.**

Fix the low point, and you fix both problems at once.

## What's Really Happening

Your swing arc has a low point—the spot where the clubhead is closest to the ground. For good iron shots:

- **The low point should be 2-4 inches ahead of the ball**
- The club hits ball first, then turf
- The divot starts after where the ball was

When your low point is behind the ball, you hit fat. When you try to correct by lifting, you hit thin. It's a pendulum of bad contact caused by the same fundamental issue.

## The Fat Shot Pattern

What causes the low point to move back:

1. **Weight stays on back foot.** If your weight doesn't transfer forward, your low point stays behind the ball.

2. **Early release (casting).** When wrists unhinge too early, the club reaches its low point before the ball.

3. **Sway instead of rotation.** Lateral movement instead of turning creates inconsistent low points.

4. **Arms disconnect from body.** When your arms outrace your body, timing becomes impossible.

The result: the club hits ground first, decelerates, and either stops cold (chunk) or slides into the ball weakly.

## The Thin Shot Pattern

Thin shots often happen when golfers *overcorrect* for fat tendencies:

1. **Standing up through impact.** Trying to avoid the ground, you pull up and catch the ball at the equator.

2. **Flipping wrists to lift.** Subconsciously trying to help the ball up creates inconsistent contact.

3. **Ball too far forward.** With the ball ahead of your low point, you catch it on the upswing.

4. **Tension and quick tempo.** Tight arms create a shorter, higher swing arc.

The irony: the golfer who keeps hitting it fat develops habits that cause thin shots, creating an endless cycle.

## The Real Fix: Control Your Low Point

Here's the counterintuitive truth: **don't try to avoid the ground—commit to hitting it in the right place.**

### Drill 1: The Line Drill

1. Draw a line in the dirt (or use a stripe on the range)
2. Make swings trying to brush the ground just after the line
3. No ball—just focus on where your club contacts turf
4. Your divot should start on or after the line, never before it

This teaches your body where your low point actually is.

### Drill 2: Step and Hit

1. Set up normally
2. As you start your downswing, step your front foot forward 3-4 inches
3. Hit the ball

This forces weight transfer forward, which pulls your low point forward. Exaggerated feeling creates lasting change.

### Drill 3: Towel Behind Ball

1. Place a folded towel 2 inches behind the ball
2. Make swings without hitting the towel
3. The only way to avoid it is to strike ball-first

Start with half swings and gradually build to full speed.

## The Posture Connection

Fat and thin shots often trace back to [setup problems](/blog/golf-setup-stance/):

- **Standing too close** leads to steep swings and chunks
- **Standing too far** leads to toe hits and thin strikes
- **Ball position too far back** encourages fat contact
- **Ball position too far forward** leads to thin/topped shots

Before changing your swing, verify your setup. Many "swing problems" are actually posture problems.

## Weight Transfer is Non-Negotiable

At impact, roughly 80% of your weight should be on your front foot. Not 50/50. Not 60/40. *Eighty percent.*

If you're balanced or back-foot dominant at impact, you cannot consistently strike ball-first. Your low point will always be unpredictable.

Feel the pressure in your front foot as you start down. Your body weight leads, your hands follow, the club trails last.

For a deeper breakdown, see our [weight transfer guide](/blog/golf-weight-transfer/).

## What Video Shows You

Fat and thin shots *feel* like your hands did something wrong. But video often reveals:

- Your head is moving backward during the downswing
- Your hips aren't rotating—they're sliding
- Your front side isn't posting up (straightening)
- Your low point is consistently behind the ball

Without video, you're guessing at causes. With video, you can see exactly what's happening.

[Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) shows you your impact position frame-by-frame. You can literally see whether your weight is forward and where your low point actually is.

## The Tempo Factor

Rushed swings mess up timing and low point control. When you swing too fast:

- Arms outrace the body rotation
- Weight transfer doesn't complete
- The club reaches the ball before it should

If you're hitting fat/thin shots in clusters, slow down your [tempo](/blog/golf-swing-tempo/). Smooth transitions give your body time to sequence properly.

## Equipment Check

Sometimes it's not you:

- **Clubs too long** force you to stand up
- **Lies too flat** dig the heel and create fat contact
- **Worn grips** cause tension and grip pressure changes

If you've never been fit, consider whether your clubs are helping or hurting your contact.

## Quick Diagnostic

Before your next round, ask yourself:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Fat shots on most irons | Weight back, early release | Step drill, forward press |
| Fat shots with long irons only | Ball too far forward | Move ball back 1 inch |
| Thin shots, especially wedges | Tension, standing up | Softer grip, stay in posture |
| Alternating fat/thin | Inconsistent setup | Alignment routine, tempo work |

## The Mental Game

Here's what nobody tells you: **fear of fat shots causes thin shots.**

When you hit one fat, your brain overcorrects. You lift through impact, creating a thin shot. Then you fear the thin, drop too hard, and hit fat again.

Break the cycle by committing to hitting the ground. Not avoiding it—*hitting it, in the right place.* Accept that even tour pros hit occasional fat shots. The difference is their low point is consistently forward, so even "fat" contact catches ball first.

## Summary

Fat and thin shots are the same problem: **low point too far back.** Fix the low point by:

1. Transferring weight forward (80% on front foot at impact)
2. Maintaining posture through impact (don't stand up)
3. Practicing hitting the ground in a specific spot
4. Verifying ball position isn't contributing

Stop fighting symptoms. Address the cause, and both problems resolve together.
