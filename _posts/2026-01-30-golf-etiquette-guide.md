Golf etiquette might seem intimidating when you're new to the game, but these unwritten rules exist for good reason. They ensure everyone enjoys their round, the course stays in great condition, and play moves efficiently. Master these guidelines and you'll feel confident stepping onto any course.

## Why Golf Etiquette Matters

Unlike most sports, golf relies heavily on self-regulation. There are no referees watching your every move. The game's traditions of honesty, respect, and consideration for others are what make it unique. Good etiquette shows respect for fellow players, the course, and the game itself.

Think of etiquette as the social contract of golf. When everyone follows these principles, the experience improves for everyone.

## On the Tee Box

### 1. Arrive Early and Be Ready

Show up at least 15 minutes before your tee time. This gives you time to warm up, check in, and be ready when your group is called. Nothing starts a round worse than rushing to the first tee unprepared.

Have your ball, tees, and club ready when it's your turn. While others hit, you can take practice swings (away from them) and visualize your shot.

### 2. The Quiet Zone

When someone is addressing their ball or swinging, absolute silence is expected. This means:
- No talking or whispering
- No movement in their peripheral vision
- No rustling through your bag
- No phone sounds

Stand still and out of their line of sight. If you're in their peripheral vision, they might ask you to move—don't take offense.

### 3. Honors and Order of Play

The player with the lowest score on the previous hole has "honors" and tees off first. On the first hole, you can flip a tee or decide among yourselves.

After the tee shot, the player farthest from the hole plays next. This continues until everyone holes out.

## Pace of Play

### 4. Keep Up with the Group Ahead

This is the most important etiquette rule in modern golf. Your goal is to keep up with the group in front of you, not stay ahead of the group behind you.

Tips for good pace:
- Walk briskly between shots
- Start planning your shot as you approach your ball
- Limit practice swings to one or two
- Pick up if you're struggling on a hole (recreational golf)
- Play "ready golf" when appropriate

### 5. Ready Golf

In casual play, "ready golf" means whoever is ready plays first, regardless of who's away. This is now encouraged by the USGA and R&A to speed up play.

Safe ready golf practices:
- Hit when it's safe and you won't disturb others
- Let faster groups play through
- Don't wait to walk to your ball while others are hitting

### 6. Let Faster Groups Play Through

If you're falling behind and the group behind is waiting, let them play through. This isn't an insult—it's good etiquette. Simply wave them up on a tee box or at a convenient point.

## Course Care

### 7. Repair Your Ball Marks

Every time your ball lands on the green and creates an indentation, repair it immediately. Use a repair tool or tee:
- Insert at an angle around the mark's edges
- Push toward the center
- Smooth with your putter

Unrepaired ball marks take weeks to heal and can affect putts. Repair one extra while you're at it to offset those who don't.

### 8. Replace Your Divots

When you take a divot with an iron, you have two options depending on the course:
- Replace the divot and step on it gently
- Fill with sand/seed mixture (if provided on carts)

Ask the pro shop which method your course prefers.

### 9. Rake the Bunkers

After escaping a bunker, rake it smooth for the next player. The general approach:
- Enter and exit from the low side when possible
- Rake your footprints and shot marks
- Leave the rake as the course indicates (inside or outside the bunker)

### 10. Respect Cart Rules

If using a cart, follow all cart path rules and signs. Common rules include:
- 90-degree rule: Drive on the path, then turn 90 degrees to your ball
- Cart path only: Stay on paths due to wet conditions
- Keep carts away from greens and tees

Walking is often better for both your game and the course.

## On the Green

### 11. Don't Step in Someone's Line

The "line" is the path between a player's ball and the hole. Never step on or across someone's putting line. Walk around, even if it's the long way.

Also be aware of the line past the hole—if they miss, that becomes their new line.

### 12. Tend the Flagstick Properly

If you're tending the pin for another player:
- Stand at arm's length, not blocking their line
- Hold the flag to prevent it from flapping
- Remove it after they strike the ball
- Don't let your shadow cross their line

With the 2019 rule change, players can now putt with the flag in. Ask your playing partners their preference.

### 13. Mark Your Ball Correctly

Place a coin or ball marker directly behind your ball before picking it up. If your marker is in someone's line, offer to move it a putter-head or two to the side. Just remember to move it back before putting.

## General Conduct

### 14. Control Your Emotions

Golf is frustrating. Even professionals struggle to control their temper. But throwing clubs, excessive cursing, or angry outbursts have no place on the course.

Take a breath. Remember why you play—for enjoyment and the challenge. Your playing partners don't deserve to share your bad mood.

### 15. Safety First

Always yell "FORE!" loudly if your ball might hit someone. Better to embarrass yourself with a false alarm than injure another player.

Never hit while others might be in range. Wait for the group ahead to be well out of distance, even if you think you can't reach them. (You might hit the best shot of your life at the worst possible moment.)

## Mobile Phone Etiquette

Keep your phone on silent. If you must take a call, step away from your group and keep it brief. Never take calls while someone is hitting.

Phones for playing music are increasingly common but remain controversial. If you play music, keep it low and ask your group if they mind.

## What Happens When You Make a Mistake

Everyone violates etiquette occasionally, even experienced players. If you make a mistake:
- Apologize sincerely
- Learn from it
- Move on without excessive self-criticism

If you see a beginner making etiquette errors, gently and privately offer guidance. We were all new once.

## The Spirit of the Game

Beyond these specific rules, golf etiquette comes down to three principles:

1. **Respect for others**: Your actions affect fellow players
2. **Respect for the course**: Leave it better than you found it
3. **Respect for the game**: Honor its traditions of honesty and sportsmanship

## Practice Your Game, Know the Rules

Good etiquette becomes second nature with experience. Pair it with solid fundamentals in your swing—check out our guides on [golf swing basics](/2026/01/30/golf-swing-basics-beginners-guide/) and [course management strategy](/2026/01/30/golf-course-management-strategy/) for a complete foundation.

Recording your swing with tools like [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) helps you improve faster so you can focus less on your mechanics and more on enjoying the game with your playing partners.

## Key Takeaways

- Keep up with the group ahead—pace of play matters most
- Stay quiet and still when others are hitting
- Repair ball marks, replace divots, rake bunkers
- Never walk in someone's putting line
- Yell "FORE!" if your ball might hit anyone
- Keep your phone silent and emotions in check

Golf is called a gentleman's game (or gentleperson's game) for a reason. These etiquette principles are what separate it from every other sport. Follow them, and you'll be welcome on any course in the world.
