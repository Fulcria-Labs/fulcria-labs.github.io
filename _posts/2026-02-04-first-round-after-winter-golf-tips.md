You have been thinking about it for weeks. Maybe months. That first round of the year is finally happening. The tee time is booked, the clubs are loaded, and you are ready to remind yourself why you love this game.

Then reality hits. The opening tee shot goes sideways. Your irons feel like foreign objects. By the fourth hole you are already eight over and wondering if you somehow forgot how to play golf.

Sound familiar? You are not alone. Almost every golfer who takes a winter break goes through the same thing. But it does not have to ruin your round. With the right approach, your first round back can actually be enjoyable -- and you might play a lot better than you expect.

Here are nine tips to help you shake off the rust and start your season on a good note.

## 1. Lower Your Expectations (Seriously)

This is the most important tip on this list, and the one most golfers ignore.

Your first round back is not the time to chase your personal best. It is not the time to test out that new swing thought you saw on Instagram. It is a reintroduction to the game after months away.

Here is a useful mental trick: add five strokes to your normal target score. If you typically shoot 88, tell yourself that anything under 93 is a solid outing. This does two things. It takes the pressure off, and it frees you up to focus on the process instead of the results.

Interestingly, many golfers report playing some of their best rounds early in the season precisely because they have lower expectations. They play within themselves, take smarter shots, and avoid forcing things. That is a powerful lesson that applies year-round.

## 2. Arrive Early and Warm Up Properly

This should be non-negotiable, but especially so for your first round of the year. Your body has been in desk-chair mode for months. Cold, tight muscles lead to compensations, bad swings, and potential injury.

Budget at least 30 minutes before your tee time. Start with dynamic stretches: arm circles, hip rotations, torso twists. Avoid static stretching before you play -- research shows it can actually reduce power output.

If the course has a practice range, hit 20-30 balls starting with your wedges and working up. Do not touch the driver until the last five swings. Your goal is not to find the perfect swing on the range. It is to wake up your body and build some rhythm.

## 3. Start With the Short Game, Not the Driver

Here is a secret that PGA professionals share with their students every spring: spend more of your pre-round time on the putting green and chipping area than on the driving range.

Why? Because the short game is where feel matters most, and feel is exactly what fades the fastest during a long layoff. Reconnecting with the speed of the greens, the way the ball comes off your wedge face, and the touch around the greens will save you more strokes than striping drivers on the range.

Spend 10-15 minutes putting before you play. Focus on lag putts first -- getting the distance right is more important than making everything. Then hit a few chips and pitch shots to find your touch.

## 4. Play the Smart Shot, Not the Hero Shot

Your [course management](/blog/golf-course-management-strategy/) skills matter more during your first round back than at any other point in the season.

The reason is simple: you do not have full confidence in your swing yet, so this is not the time to take on risky shots. That driver over the water on hole 3? Lay up with a hybrid. The tucked pin behind a bunker? Aim for the center of the green.

Here is a practical rule of thumb for your first round back: aim for the biggest target available on every shot. Wide part of the fairway off the tee. Middle of the green on approach shots. Conservative lines on chips and putts.

You are not playing scared. You are playing smart. There is a big difference.

## 5. Focus on Tempo, Not Mechanics

After a winter break, your natural instinct is to start tinkering with your swing. Resist that urge.

Your muscle memory is still in there. It just needs a gentle nudge, not a complete overhaul. The fastest way to bring it back is to focus on [tempo](/blog/golf-swing-tempo/) rather than positions.

Try this on the first tee: take a few smooth practice swings at about 75% effort. Feel the rhythm. Then step up and swing at the same easy pace. You will be surprised how well the ball flies when you are not trying to crush it.

The 3:1 ratio (backswing to downswing) that tour pros use is a great reference point. Count "one-two-three" on the way back and "one" on the way down. That smooth, unhurried rhythm is your best friend on day one.

## 6. Use One Extra Club on Every Approach Shot

Cold weather and rusty swings both reduce your distance. In February, you might be dealing with both at the same time.

The fix is simple: club up on every approach shot. If you normally hit your 7-iron 150 yards, grab the 6-iron instead. Most amateurs miss greens short far more often than they miss long, and adding that extra club takes pressure off your swing. You do not need a perfect strike to reach the green.

This also helps with tempo. When you have more club in your hands, you naturally swing easier. Easier swings lead to better contact. Better contact leads to better scores. It is a virtuous cycle.

## 7. Walk If You Can

If the course and your body allow it, walk your first round back instead of riding. Walking keeps your muscles warm between shots, maintains your rhythm, and gives you time to mentally prepare for each shot.

Riding in a cart on a cold February morning means you go from sitting and getting stiff to swinging as hard as you can, then sitting down again. That is a recipe for sore muscles and inconsistent play.

If walking the full 18 is too much, consider walking the front nine and riding the back. Even partial walking helps.

## 8. Play a Shamble or Scramble Format

If you are going out with friends, consider playing a shamble (everyone tees off, pick the best drive, then play your own ball from there) or a scramble for your first round. These formats take the pressure off individual shots and let you ease back into competitive play without the sting of blowing up on a single hole.

It also keeps the pace of play moving, which matters when everyone in your group is fighting the same early-season rust.

## 9. Record Your Swing for a Baseline

Here is one of the smartest things you can do during your first round back: film a few swings. Not to post on social media. Not to tear apart your mechanics. Just to establish a baseline.

After a winter away from golf, you might not realize how much your swing has drifted. Your posture might have changed. Your backswing might be shorter or longer than you think. Having video from your first round gives you a reference point so you can track your progress as the season unfolds.

You can use [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) to get a quick AI-powered breakdown of your swing right there on the course. It takes about 90 seconds, and you do not need a tripod or a perfect camera angle -- just prop your phone up and swing. That early-season snapshot becomes incredibly valuable a few weeks later when you want to see how far your swing has come.

## Bonus: The One-Week Prep Plan

If you have a week before your first round, here is a simple plan to shake off the worst of the rust:

**Days 1-2:** Hit the putting green for 20 minutes. Roll putts from 3 feet, 10 feet, and 30 feet. Get your speed back.

**Days 3-4:** Hit a small bucket at the range. Wedges and short irons only. Focus on clean contact, not distance.

**Days 5-6:** Hit a medium bucket. Work through the bag up to your driver. Keep the tempo smooth.

**Day 7:** Play your round. Follow the tips above.

This low-pressure ramp-up gives your body and brain time to remember the patterns without overwhelming either one.

## The Bottom Line

Your first round after winter is not supposed to be your best round of the year. Let go of that expectation and you will enjoy it a lot more.

Focus on tempo, play smart, and give yourself grace when things go wrong. The rust will come off. It always does. And by your third or fourth round, you will feel like you never put the clubs away.

If you want to speed up the process, [filming your swing early in the season](/blog/phone-golf-swing-video/) is one of the best investments you can make. You will spot the old habits before they settle back in, and you will have a clear roadmap for what to work on as the months get warmer.

Now go book that tee time. The course is waiting.
