## Understanding Putter Fitting

Unlike other clubs, putter fitting focuses on matching the club to your natural stroke:

### Key Fitting Elements

**1. Length**
- Standard: 33-35 inches
- Too long: Eyes behind the ball, pushed putts
- Too short: Eyes over the ball, pulled putts

**2. Lie Angle**
- Affects where the putter sits at address
- Wrong lie angle = aiming errors before you even stroke

**3. Toe Hang**
- **High toe hang**: Opens and closes naturally, suits arced strokes
- **Face balanced**: Stays square, suits straight-back-straight-through
- **Zero torque**: Eliminates rotation completely

**4. Weight**
- Heavier putters: More stability, better on slower greens
- Lighter putters: More feel, better on faster greens

### Quick Fitting Guide

| Your Natural Stroke | Best Toe Hang | Best Style |
|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| Strong arc (like a door opening) | High toe hang | Blade |
| Moderate arc | Moderate toe hang | Mid-mallet |
| Straight back-straight through | Face balanced | Mallet |
| Inconsistent | Zero torque | L.A.B., Evnroll Zero |

---

## Price Guide: What to Expect

| Category | Price Range | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Ultra-Premium** | $500-700 | L.A.B. Golf, Scotty Cameron Special Select |
| **Premium** | $400-500 | Scotty Cameron, Evnroll, Ping PLD |
| **Standard** | $300-400 | TaylorMade Spider, Odyssey Ai-One |
| **Value** | $150-300 | Odyssey White Hot OG, Cleveland Huntington Beach |
| **Budget** | $50-150 | Previous-year models, off-brand |

**Pro tip:** Unlike drivers, putters don't go obsolete. A 3-year-old premium putter often performs identically to the latest release.

## Blade vs. Mallet: How to Choose

### Choose a Blade If:
- You have an arced putting stroke
- You prioritize feel over forgiveness
- You're a low-handicap player with consistent contact
- You prefer a classic, compact look at address
- You like to work the ball (draw/fade putts)

### Choose a Mallet If:
- You have a straight-back-straight-through stroke
- You want maximum forgiveness on mishits
- You benefit from strong alignment aids
- You struggle with face angle consistency
- You prefer a mechanical, repeatable motion

### Choose Zero-Torque If:
- You fight face manipulation throughout your stroke
- You want the putter to do the work
- You're willing to invest in consistency
- You have an inconsistent stroke path
- You want to eliminate variables

---

## Common Putter Mistakes

### 1. Choosing based on looks alone
What looks good in the store may not match your stroke. Get fitted or at least test with intention.

### 2. Wrong toe hang for your stroke
High toe hang with a straight stroke = constant manipulation. Face balanced with an arc = fighting the club.

### 3. Wrong length
Most golfers use putters that are too long. This forces compensations in posture and aim.

### 4. Ignoring weight preferences
Some golfers need heavy putters for stability; others feel more connected with lighter ones.

### 5. Chasing the latest release
A $500 putter won't fix a flawed stroke. The [fundamentals matter more](/blog/putting-fundamentals/).

## Should You Get Fitted?

**Yes, if:**
- You're investing $300+ in a putter
- You're fighting consistent issues (pushes, pulls, distance control)
- You've never been fitted before
- You're a serious competitive golfer

**Maybe not, if:**
- You're buying a budget putter
- You've found what works through trial and error
- You're new to golf and your stroke will evolve

**Where to get fitted:**
- Club Champion ($100-150)
- GOLFTEC ($50-100)
- PGA Tour Superstore (often free)
- Many pro shops with SAM PuttLab or similar technology

## Putting Improvement: Equipment vs. Technique

Before spending $500 on a new putter, consider whether your technique is the limiting factor:

**Signs your putter is the problem:**
- Consistently hit good putts that miss
- Putter doesn't match your stroke type
- Putter length/lie is clearly wrong
- You can't aim consistently

**Signs your technique is the problem:**
- Inconsistent contact location on face
- Varying speed control
- Poor green reading
- Breakdown under pressure

[Learn putting fundamentals](/blog/putting-fundamentals/) and [record your stroke](/blog/phone-golf-swing-video/) to identify what's really holding you back. Often, a [simple alignment fix](/blog/golf-alignment-aim/) makes more difference than new equipment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should my putter be?

Standard lengths are 33-35 inches. Your correct length depends on your height, arm length, and setup posture. At address, your eyes should be directly over or just inside the ball.

### Are expensive putters worth it?

Premium putters ($400+) offer better materials, tighter tolerances, and more options. But a $250 Odyssey White Hot OG performs comparably for most golfers. Pay for premium when you can feel the difference.

### Blade or mallet for beginners?

Mallet. The forgiveness and alignment aids help beginners develop consistency. Switch to a blade later if your stroke evolves toward an arc.

### How often should I replace my putter?

Unlike wedges, putters don't wear out. Replace when your stroke changes, your preferences evolve, or fitting reveals a mismatch. Many golfers use the same putter for decades.

### Do alignment aids actually help?

Yes—most golfers aim worse than they think. Strong alignment aids (like Spider's True Path) measurably improve setup accuracy, especially under pressure.

---

## The Bottom Line

For most golfers, the **TaylorMade Spider Tour** or **Odyssey Ai-One Jailbird** will deliver excellent results. Both offer exceptional forgiveness, easy alignment, and consistent performance.

Feel-first players should seriously consider the **Scotty Cameron Newport 2** or **Phantom** for unmatched craftsmanship.

Players fighting inconsistency should explore zero-torque options like the **L.A.B. Golf MEZZ.1 MAX** or **Evnroll Zero**.

Budget-conscious? The **Odyssey White Hot OG** is a best-seller for a reason.

**Next steps:**
1. [Analyze your putting stroke](/blog/putting-fundamentals/) to understand your needs
2. Get fitted at a local pro shop with putter fitting technology
3. Try 3-4 models that match your stroke type
4. Consider previous-year models for savings
