![Why Video Changed My Golf Game (And Why It'll Change Yours)](/assets/images/video-golf-swing.png)
I played golf for 15 years before I first recorded my swing. What I saw shocked me.

My "pause at the top"? Non-existent. My "inside takeaway"? Actually outside. My "steady head"? Moving six inches.

Everything I thought I was doing was wrong. And I had no idea.

This is the most important lesson I've learned about golf improvement: **you cannot trust your feelings.**

## The Feel vs. Real Problem

Golf is one of the few sports where what you feel doesn't match what's real. You can make a swing that feels completely different but looks nearly identical on video.

Tour pros know this. That's why every practice session includes video. They've learned not to trust feel alone.

Amateur golfers spend years grooving bad habits because they've never verified what their swing actually looks like.

## Why This Happens

The brain creates a model of your body position based on:
- Muscle tension
- Joint positions
- Balance signals
- Visual cues (ball flight, impact feeling)

But this model is imperfect. Your brain fills in gaps with assumptions - assumptions based on what you're *trying* to do, not what you're *actually* doing.

This is why:
- The [slice fix](/blog/fix-golf-slice/) you've been working on hasn't worked
- Your [practice sessions](/blog/golf-practice-routine/) don't translate to the course
- You keep making the same mistakes year after year

You're practicing what you *think* you're doing. Video shows what you're *actually* doing.

## The Research on Video Feedback

Studies on motor learning consistently show that video feedback accelerates skill acquisition:

- Golfers who use video feedback improve 2-3x faster than those who don't
- The benefit is greatest for complex movements (like the golf swing)
- Even watching video without coaching provides significant improvement

The mechanism is simple: video closes the feedback loop. You execute, you see the result, you adjust. Without video, the feedback loop is broken.

## What to Film

### Angle 1: Down the Line (Behind You)

- Club path (inside/outside)
- Plane angle
- Head movement
- Extension through impact

### Angle 2: Face On (In Front)

- [Weight shift](/blog/golf-weight-transfer/)
- [Hip rotation](/blog/golf-hip-rotation/)
- Arm structure at impact
- [Posture throughout swing](/blog/golf-setup-stance/)

**You need both angles to get the full picture.** Each reveals different information.

### Optional: Angle 3 - Overhead (Caddy View)

If you have access to an overhead camera or elevated position:
- Shows rotation patterns
- Reveals takeaway direction
- Demonstrates path through the ball

This angle is less common but increasingly used by tour players and teaching pros.

## How to Set Up Video

**Phone position:**

- Down the line: camera at hand height, pointing at the ball
- Face on: camera at waist height, centered on your body

**Distance:** 8-10 feet away

**Frame rate:** Most phones default to 30fps. Switch to 120fps or 240fps if available - slow motion reveals details impossible to see at normal speed.

**Tripod or phone holder:** A stable mount isn't required but helps enormously. The $15 investment in a phone tripod will transform your practice sessions. Check out our guide on [recording swings without equipment](/blog/phone-golf-swing-video/) for alternatives.

**Lighting:** Face the sun or primary light source. Backlighting (sun behind you) creates silhouettes that hide detail.

## Common Filming Mistakes

**Wrong height:** Camera too high or too low distorts the image. Hand height for down-the-line, hip height for face-on.

**Too far away:** If you can't clearly see your hands and clubhead, you're too far.

**Moving camera:** Even small movements make analysis difficult. Stabilize your phone.

**Wrong angle:** Not perpendicular to target line creates false readings of swing plane and path.

**Missing key moments:** Start recording before you address the ball. Many issues begin in setup.

## What to Look For

Start with the basics:

1. Where is your club at the top of the backswing?
2. What direction is the shaft moving in transition?
3. Where is your clubhead at impact relative to your hands?
4. What's your body position at finish?

Compare these positions to what you intended. **The gap between intention and reality is your improvement opportunity.**

## Key Checkpoints by Position

**Address:**
- Spine angle approximately 30-40 degrees from vertical
- Weight centered or slightly toward balls of feet
- Hands below chin level
- Arms hanging naturally

**Top of backswing:**
- Shoulder rotation 85-95 degrees (for full swings)
- Hip rotation 40-50 degrees
- Left arm relatively straight (for right-handers)
- Club on or near the [swing plane](/blog/golf-swing-plane-explained/)

**Impact:**
- Weight shifted to lead side
- Hips open to target
- [Hands ahead of clubhead](/blog/golf-impact-position/)
- Head behind ball position

**Follow-through:**
- Full rotation facing target
- Balanced finish
- Club over lead shoulder

Draw lines on your video to check these positions. Most analysis apps allow line-drawing tools.

## The Feedback Loop

Video creates a feedback loop that accelerates learning:

1. Film your swing
2. Identify one issue
3. Feel a correction
4. Film again
5. Compare before/after

This loop - execute, observe, adjust - is how all motor skills develop. Without the "observe" step, you're practicing blindly.

**Important:** Don't overanalyze during practice. Hit 5-10 balls, then review video. Making a change, then immediately checking video, then making another change creates analysis paralysis.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

The most powerful use of video is comparison:

**Before/After:** Compare your swing before and after working on a change. Did you actually change what you intended?

**Good swing vs. bad swing:** What's different between your best shots and worst shots? Often the answer is obvious on video.

**Your swing vs. model:** Compare your positions to a tour player with a similar body type. Not to copy exactly, but to understand the differences.

## From Video to AI Analysis

Raw video shows you what's happening but not always why it matters or how to fix it.

AI swing analyzers add a layer of interpretation:

- What specific issues exist in your swing
- Which issues matter most
- What drills address those issues
- How you compare to your previous swings

Think of it as having a swing coach review every video you take.

## Building the Video Habit

To get the most from video:

**Film every practice session:** Not just special occasions. Make video a standard part of practice.

**Review honestly:** Don't explain away what you see. If your swing looks different than you thought, believe the video.

**Save key videos:** Keep examples of your best swings and your worst. Track progress over time.

**Share with your instructor:** If you take lessons, video between sessions gives your pro insight into your practice.

## Getting Started Today

You don't need fancy equipment. Your smartphone is enough. Start filming every practice session and watch with honest eyes.

The gap between feel and real might surprise you. But seeing the truth is the first step to actually improving.

Next time you practice, spend five minutes filming. Compare what you see to what you felt. If there's a gap - and there will be - you've just discovered your fastest path to improvement.
