# Master the Scoring Zone: How to Attack from 100 Yards and In

You striped a perfect drive down the middle. Now you're standing 85 yards from the pin. This should be a birdie opportunity. But somehow, you end up making bogey.

Sound familiar?

The scoring zone, those shots inside 100 yards, is where rounds are made or lost. Tour pros hit it inside 10 feet from 75-100 yards over 30 percent of the time. Most amateurs are happy just to find the green. Here's how to close that gap and start attacking pins.

## Why the Scoring Zone Matters Most

Consider where your strokes actually go. Most golfers obsess over driver distance when the real scoring happens inside 100 yards. Here's the math:

- **Driving**: You hit driver 14 times per round
- **Scoring zone**: You hit wedges and short irons 20-25 times per round

Even small improvements in wedge play compound quickly. Getting 5 feet closer on 10 approach shots? That's potentially 3-4 saved strokes per round.

Yet most golfers spend 80 percent of practice time hitting driver and long irons. The practice time allocation is exactly backwards.

## Know Your Numbers

Here's the first problem: most golfers don't actually know their wedge distances. They have a vague idea. "My pitching wedge goes about 120." But they've never tested it systematically.

### Building Your Distance Chart

You need three numbers for each wedge:

1. **Full swing carry distance**
2. **Three-quarter swing carry distance**
3. **Half swing carry distance**

Carry, not total distance. The ball rolling out varies with green conditions, but carry is consistent.

Go to the range with a rangefinder or use a launch monitor. Hit 10 balls with each wedge at each swing length. Throw out the best and worst two. Average the remaining six. That's your real number.

Most golfers are shocked. Their "120 yard pitching wedge" actually carries 108. Their "90 yard sand wedge" is more like 82.

### The Gap Problem

Once you know your numbers, check for gaps. You should have distance coverage every 10-12 yards from 50 to 130 yards. If you have gaps, you're either:

- Missing a wedge (consider adding a gap wedge)
- Not using your three-quarter and half swings enough

Having to choose between a hard 70 percent swing and an easy 100 percent swing is a recipe for inconsistency.

## The Stock Shot Approach

Tour pros don't try to manufacture different shots for every distance. They have stock shots, reliable plays they can execute under pressure.

### Your 100-Yard Shot

Pick one wedge and one swing for 100 yards. This should feel repeatable. For most golfers, it's a smooth gap wedge or a controlled pitching wedge.

Practice this shot until it's automatic. When you stand over a 100-yard shot in competition, there should be zero doubt about club selection or swing.

### Building Your Scoring Zone Arsenal

Expand from there:

- **100 yards**: Stock full swing with one wedge
- **85 yards**: Three-quarter swing same wedge, or full swing shorter wedge
- **70 yards**: Your most reliable half-to-three-quarter motion
- **55 yards**: Pitching motion with your highest-lofted wedge

The fewer decisions you have to make under pressure, the better you'll execute.

## Distance Control: The Real Skill

Here's what separates good wedge players from average ones: they control distance with their body, not their hands.

### The Body-Controlled Swing

Your chest rotation determines distance. Hands manipulating the club leads to inconsistency. Think of your arms and club as connected to your body turn.

For a three-quarter shot:
- Turn your chest to three-quarters of your full backswing
- Rotate through to a three-quarter finish
- Maintain consistent tempo

The club follows. Your hands stay quiet.

### Common Distance Control Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Adjusting with grip pressure**
Gripping tighter for a shorter shot kills feel. Keep grip pressure constant and use rotation length instead.

**Mistake 2: Slowing down through impact**
Deceleration destroys contact. Make a shorter backswing if you need less distance, but always accelerate through.

**Mistake 3: Changing your tempo**
Your rhythm should be identical for full, three-quarter, and half shots. Only the length of swing changes, not the speed of the tempo.

## Trajectory Control

From the scoring zone, you have options. Should you flight it in high and soft, or run it in low with spin?

### When to Go High

- **Soft greens**: Ball will stop where it lands
- **Tucked pins**: Need to fly it close and sit
- **Downwind**: High trajectory fights wind effect
- **Uphill green**: Ball naturally stops faster

### When to Go Low

- **Firm greens**: Let the ball release to the hole
- **Into wind**: Lower flight minimizes wind impact
- **Pin at back**: Land short and run it back
- **Fear of going long**: Safer play with less carry distance

### How to Adjust Trajectory

For a lower shot:
- Ball back in stance (one ball width)
- Hands slightly ahead at address
- Abbreviated finish (don't release fully)

For a higher shot:
- Ball forward in stance
- Hands neutral at address
- Full release and high finish

Don't try to lift the ball. Trust the loft to do the work.

## Practice Drills for the Scoring Zone

### The 3-Club Game

Take only three wedges to the practice green. Drop balls at random distances from 30 to 100 yards. For each shot:

1. Pick a target
2. Choose your club and shot type
3. Commit and execute
4. Score yourself: inside 10 feet = 2 points, on green = 1 point, miss green = 0

Play to 20 points. This builds decision-making and simulates course conditions.

### The Landing Zone Drill

Pick a specific landing spot for each shot, not just a target. Place a towel or headcover where you want the ball to land. Practice hitting that landing spot.

This is how tour pros think. They're not aiming at the flag, they're picking a landing zone and letting the ball release to the hole.

### The Ladder Drill

Set targets at 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 yards. Hit one ball to each target, going up and down the ladder. Focus on changing swing length while maintaining tempo.

This builds the feel for different distances without changing your fundamental motion.

### The One-Club Challenge

Take only your gap wedge (or 52-degree) to the range. Hit shots to every target from 40 to full distance. You'll discover:

- How many distances one club can cover
- What swing lengths produce what distances
- Your natural stock shot with that wedge

## On-Course Strategy

Knowing your distances and having reliable shots is only part of the equation. You need smart strategy too.

### Play to the Fat of the Green

Tour pros miss the center of the green more than pins. They're playing to the biggest landing area and letting proximity take care of itself.

From 80 yards with a tucked pin, the smart play is often the middle of the green. Two-putt bogey beats bunker or water.

### Know Your Miss

Every golfer has a tendency. Maybe you pull short irons left. Maybe you hit them thin when nervous. Factor your miss into your target selection.

If you pull wedges, aim at the right edge of the green. Your pulls still find the putting surface, and your good shots end up middle-left.

### Avoid Short-Sided

The most dangerous miss from inside 100 yards is short-sided. Missing on the side where the pin is located leaves an impossible up-and-down.

When in doubt, miss toward the center of the green. Even if you're 30 feet away, two-putt is likely. Short-sided in a bunker? That's bogey or worse.

## Equipment Considerations

Your wedge setup matters in the scoring zone. Here's what to consider:

### Wedge Gaps

Check the loft spacing in your wedges. Standard sets often have gaps:

- Pitching wedge: 45 degrees
- Gap wedge: 50 degrees
- Sand wedge: 56 degrees

That's a 6-degree gap between PW and gap wedge, but only 6 degrees between gap wedge and sand wedge. Consider a 52-degree and 58-degree setup for more even spacing.

### Bounce for Your Conditions

Higher bounce (12-14 degrees) helps on soft conditions and fluffy lies. Lower bounce (8-10 degrees) is better on tight lies and firm conditions.

Many golfers have wrong bounce for their courses. If you're digging into soft turf, you need more bounce. If you're skulling off tight lies, you might need less.

### Shaft Considerations

Wedge shafts should promote consistency, not distance. Many golfers use the same shafts in their wedges as their irons, which works. Some prefer slightly heavier wedge shafts for added control.

Whatever you choose, keep it consistent across your wedge set.

## Using Technology to Improve

### Video Analysis

Recording your wedge swings reveals issues you can't feel. Use [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) to check:

- Backswing length at different distances
- Whether your tempo stays consistent
- Impact position and body rotation

What you think you're doing and what you're actually doing rarely match. Video doesn't lie.

### Track Your Stats

Start tracking your proximity from different distances. Most golf apps can record where your approach shots end up.

After 10 rounds, you'll have real data:

- Average proximity from 75-100 yards
- Average proximity from 50-75 yards
- Your best and worst wedge distances

This shows exactly where to focus your practice.

## The 30-Day Scoring Zone Challenge

Want to see real improvement? Try this practice plan:

**Week 1: Know Your Numbers**
- Test all wedge distances (full, 3/4, 1/2)
- Create your distance chart
- Identify gaps in coverage

**Week 2: Stock Shot Development**
- Pick your 100-yard shot and own it
- Hit 50 balls per day to that exact distance
- Build automatic feel

**Week 3: Distance Control**
- Ladder drill daily
- One-club challenge twice
- Focus on body-controlled distance

**Week 4: On-Course Application**
- Use your new distance knowledge
- Track proximity to the hole
- Commit to your stock shots

Most golfers will see 2-4 strokes improvement in one month with focused scoring zone practice.

## The Bottom Line

The scoring zone is where your score lives. Driver distance is fun, but wedge proximity determines whether you're making birdies or grinding for pars.

Master these fundamentals:

1. **Know your real distances** (carry, not total)
2. **Develop stock shots** you trust under pressure
3. **Control distance with your body**, not your hands
4. **Practice with purpose**, not mindlessly hitting balls

Spend 50 percent of your practice time inside 100 yards. It's not as satisfying as bombing drivers, but it's where scores actually drop.

The next time you're standing in the fairway with an 80-yard approach, you should feel confident. Pick your landing spot, trust your swing, and attack the pin. That's how golf is supposed to feel.
