# How to Fix Early Extension in Your Golf Swing

You set up with perfect posture. Knees flexed, spine tilted, ready to rotate. Then somewhere between backswing and impact, your hips drift toward the ball and you stand up through the shot. Sound familiar?

That movement is called early extension, and it affects roughly 65% of amateur golfers. It's one of the most common swing faults in the game, and it's responsible for everything from thin contact to unpredictable shot patterns.

The good news: once you understand what's happening and why, fixing it becomes much more straightforward.

## What Is Early Extension?

Early extension occurs when your pelvis moves closer to the golf ball during the downswing. Instead of rotating around a stable center, your hips thrust forward toward the ball. Your body compensates by standing up, losing the spine angle you established at address.

Watch any tour player from the down-the-line camera angle. Their belt buckle stays the same distance from the ball throughout the swing. Their backside maintains what instructors call the "tush line" from setup through impact.

Now watch most amateurs. The hips push toward the ball, the spine straightens, and by impact they're standing significantly taller than they were at address.

## Why Early Extension Hurts Your Game

This forward thrust creates a chain reaction of problems.

**Inconsistent contact.** When your body moves toward the ball, the bottom of your swing arc moves with it. One swing you catch it thin, the next you chunk behind it. The moving target makes solid contact feel random.

**Loss of power.** Your hips generate most of your swing speed. But they generate that speed through rotation, not through linear movement. Thrusting forward actually slows your rotation and costs you distance.

**Unpredictable shot shape.** Early extension typically produces two misses: the block and the hook. When you stand up, your swing path shifts right. If the face is open, the ball blocks right. If you flip your hands to save it, the ball hooks left. Neither is consistent.

**Lower back strain.** Your spine hyperextends to make room for your arms. Do this enough times, and your lower back will let you know.

## How to Diagnose It Yourself

You don't need expensive equipment to spot early extension. Just your phone and a friend (or a tripod).

**The down-the-line test.** Have someone record your swing from directly behind you, camera at hip height. Draw an imaginary line along your backside at address. Now watch what happens during the downswing. Does your backside stay on that line, or does it move toward the ball?

**The face-on test.** Film from in front of you. At address, note how far your belt buckle is from the ball. At impact, is it closer? If your hips have moved forward, you've got early extension.

**The feel checkpoints.** Finish a swing and hold your follow-through. Can you wiggle your toes? If all your weight has shifted to your toes, your hips likely thrust forward. Proper hip rotation keeps you balanced through your whole foot.

## Common Causes of Early Extension

Early extension is usually a compensation, not the root problem. Here's what typically triggers it.

**Tight hip flexors.** If your hips can't rotate freely, they'll take the path of least resistance: forward. Golfers who sit at desks all day often develop tight hip flexors that limit rotational range of motion.

**Weak glutes.** Your glutes stabilize your pelvis during the swing. If they're weak, your pelvis can't resist the forces trying to push it forward.

**Standing too far from the ball.** If you're reaching at address, your body may thrust forward during the downswing to get closer to the ball.

**Over-the-top swing path.** When the club comes down steep and outside, many golfers instinctively thrust their hips forward to create space for the hands. Fixing the [swing path](/blog/shallowing-golf-club) often helps reduce early extension.

**Excessive grip pressure.** Tension in your hands restricts wrist hinge, which can cause the body to compensate with early extension.

**Ball position too far forward.** If the ball is ahead of where your swing naturally bottoms out, you may thrust toward it unconsciously.

## Drills to Fix Early Extension

These drills train your body to rotate rather than thrust.

### The Wall Drill

Stand with your backside touching a wall, in your golf posture. Make slow practice swings while keeping contact with the wall throughout the entire swing. Your backside should never leave the wall.

Start without a club, just making arm swings. Progress to holding a club. If you can't rotate without losing contact, that's exactly the pattern you need to retrain.

Do 20 repetitions daily. It takes about three minutes.

### The Chair Drill

Place a chair or stool about six inches behind your rear end at address. Make swings while keeping your backside in contact with the chair from setup through impact.

This variation works better for some golfers because the chair provides tactile feedback throughout the swing, not just at setup.

### The Headcover Drill

Place a headcover or small towel between your thighs just above your knees. Make swings without letting it fall. This engages your adductors and glutes, helping stabilize your pelvis.

The key is maintaining consistent pressure on the headcover throughout the swing. If you thrust forward, you'll typically lose the squeeze.

### The Pool Noodle Drill

Cut a pool noodle in half and place it vertically in the ground behind your trail hip at address. Make swings without hitting the noodle on the downswing. If your hip thrusts forward, you'll knock it over.

This drill provides immediate feedback without requiring you to think about body positions.

## What Proper Hip Action Should Feel Like

When you fix early extension, proper hip rotation feels different than you might expect.

**Rotation, not thrust.** Instead of moving toward the ball, your hips should feel like they're spinning in place. Your belt buckle turns toward the target while your backside stays on the same plane it started on.

**Ground pressure through your heels.** With proper rotation, you'll feel more pressure through your heels at impact, not your toes. Many golfers describe the feeling as "sitting into the shot."

**Space for your arms.** When your hips rotate rather than thrust, you create room for your arms to swing through without manipulation. The swing feels effortless because your body isn't fighting for space.

**Connected through impact.** [Proper hip rotation](/blog/golf-hip-rotation-guide) and [weight transfer](/blog/golf-weight-transfer-guide) work together. Your lower body leads, your upper body follows, and everything arrives at impact in sync.

## Building the New Pattern

Early extension is stubborn because it often develops over years. Your body learned it for a reason, usually to compensate for something else in your swing.

Be patient. Work the drills daily for at least three weeks before expecting to see changes on the course. Film your swing weekly to track progress. What feels like a massive change in your body often looks like a small improvement on video.

And remember: early extension sometimes feels powerful because thrusting forward creates the sensation of effort. Proper rotation feels quieter, more controlled. Trust the process.
