# Golf Alignment: Why You're Aiming Wrong (And How to Fix It)

Here's an uncomfortable truth: most amateur golfers are poorly aligned at address—and they have no idea. Studies of recreational golfers show average aim errors of 10-20 yards off target. The frustrating part? Many swing faults are actually subconscious compensations for bad alignment.

## The Railroad Track Concept

Proper golf alignment works like railroad tracks:

- **Target line**: An imaginary line from your ball to the target
- **Body line**: Where your feet, hips, and shoulders point

These lines run parallel to each other—they don't intersect at the target. Your body should aim slightly left of the target (for right-handed golfers), while the clubface aims directly at it.

The most common mistake? Aiming your feet at the target. This actually sets you up to swing left of target, which is why so many golfers hit pulls or pull-slices.

## How Misalignment Creates Swing Faults

When you're aimed incorrectly, your brain knows the ball won't go where you want. It compensates:

**Aimed too far right:**
- You sense the ball will go right
- Subconsciously swing more left to compensate
- Creates an over-the-top move and slice spin
- The more you slice, the more you aim right—a vicious cycle

**Aimed too far left:**
- You sense the ball will go left
- Push your hands out or hold off the release
- Creates blocks and weak fades
- Or you flip the hands, causing hooks

Many golfers spend years fighting swing faults that would disappear with proper alignment.

## The Alignment Check Every Golfer Needs

Here's how to test your actual alignment:

1. Set up to a ball as you normally would
2. Have a friend lay a club along your toe line
3. Step back and look where that club points
4. Do the same for your shoulder line (lay a club across your chest)

Most golfers are shocked to find they're 15+ yards offline. What's worse, feet and shoulders often point in different directions.

## Proper Alignment Setup

### Feet
Parallel left of target line. An easy reference: if you dropped a ball from your big toe, it would roll to a point left of your actual target.

### Hips
Parallel to feet. The hip line should match your foot line. Some golfers get their feet right but their hips remain closed or open.

### Shoulders
This is the most important—and most ignored—alignment point. Where your shoulders aim has more influence on swing path than your feet. Match them to your feet and hip line.

### Clubface
This is the only thing that should aim at the target. Set the clubface first, then build your stance around it.

## The Intermediate Target Trick

Tour players don't aim at distant targets. They pick a spot 2-3 feet in front of their ball that's on the target line—a divot, leaf, or discolored grass. This close target is much easier to align to than something 200 yards away.

**How to use it:**
1. Stand behind the ball, looking at your target
2. Find a spot 2-3 feet in front of the ball on that line
3. Walk into your stance, aiming the clubface at that spot
4. Build your parallel body lines from there

This technique alone can fix years of alignment problems.

## Home Practice: The Wall Drill

You don't need a range to work on alignment:

1. Find a wall or door frame
2. Set up as if hitting a ball, with the wall as your target
3. Your toe line, hip line, and shoulder line should all be parallel to the wall
4. Close your eyes, take your stance, then open them
5. Check if you're parallel—most aren't at first

Practice this daily for a week and your alignment will become second nature.

## Range Practice: Alignment Sticks

Two alignment sticks cost less than a sleeve of balls and will transform your practice:

**Setup:**
1. Place one stick on your target line (through where the ball would be)
2. Place another stick parallel, just outside your feet
3. Hit shots with these references in place

The visual feedback prevents you from drifting back to old habits. Even tour players use this setup regularly.

## Common Alignment Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Aiming the Body at the Target
Your body lines are parallel left, not pointing at the flag.

### Mistake 2: Setting Stance Before Clubface
Always aim the clubface first, then set your body parallel to that line.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Shoulder Alignment
Feet can be perfect while shoulders are open or closed. Check all three lines.

### Mistake 4: Different Alignment for Every Club
Your alignment fundamentals should be the same from wedge to driver. The only thing that changes is ball position and stance width.

## Using Video to Check Alignment

Film your setup from directly behind you (down the target line). Draw a line on your ball-to-target line and another along your feet. Are they parallel? If not, adjust until they are.

This is one of the most valuable uses of video analysis—catching alignment issues that feel correct but aren't.
