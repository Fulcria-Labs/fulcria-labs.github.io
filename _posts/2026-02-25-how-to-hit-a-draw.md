# How to Hit a Draw: The Complete Guide to Curving the Ball Right-to-Left

A draw is one of the most sought-after shots in golf. It curves gently from right to left (for right-handed golfers), typically travels farther than a fade, and gives you that satisfying feeling of controlling your ball flight. Here's how to hit one consistently.

## What Causes a Draw?

Before you can hit a draw, you need to understand the ball flight laws:

**The Two Factors:**
1. **Club path** - the direction your club is moving through impact
2. **Face angle** - where the clubface is pointing at impact

For a draw, you need:
- A club path that travels to the right of your target (in-to-out)
- A clubface that's closed relative to your path but open relative to your target

The ball starts where the face is pointing and curves away from the path.

## Step-by-Step: How to Hit a Draw

### 1. Strengthen Your Grip Slightly

A stronger grip makes it easier to close the face through impact:
- Rotate both hands slightly clockwise on the grip
- You should see 3 knuckles on your left hand at address
- The V's formed by your thumbs and forefingers point toward your right shoulder

**Don't overdo it.** A grip that's too strong causes hooks.

### 2. Align Your Body Right

Your feet, hips, and shoulders should aim slightly right of your target (for right-handed players). This encourages an in-to-out swing path.

- Pick a target 10-20 yards right of where you want the ball to finish
- Align your body to that intermediate target
- Keep the clubface pointing at your actual target

This creates the path-face relationship that produces draw spin.

### 3. Ball Position: Slightly Back

Move the ball about half an inch back from your normal position. This:
- Gives you more time to close the face
- Promotes a more inside approach
- Helps you catch the ball on the inside portion

### 4. Feel the Inside-Out Path

The swing feel that produces a draw:
- On the downswing, feel like you're dropping the club behind you
- Swing out toward right field (for righties)
- Finish with your hands high and to the right

**Key image:** Imagine the ball is on a clock face. Instead of swinging at 12 o'clock, swing toward 1 or 2 o'clock.

### 5. Release the Club Fully

The final ingredient is a full release:
- Let your forearms rotate through impact
- The toe of the club should pass the heel after impact
- Don't hold off the release - that causes a push or fade

## Common Draw Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Closing the Face Too Much
If your draw turns into a hook, the face is too closed. Open your stance slightly more or weaken your grip.

### Mistake 2: Path Too Far Inside
A path that's too far right causes pushes (if the face matches) or push-hooks (if the face is closed). Check that your backswing isn't getting too flat.

### Mistake 3: Early Extension
Standing up through impact makes it hard to maintain the inside path. Keep your posture through the ball.

## The "Feels" That Work

Different golfers respond to different feels. Try these:

1. **"Exit right"** - Focus on where the club exits after impact. A draw exit is to the right of target.

2. **"Close the door"** - Imagine closing a door with your right hand through impact.

3. **"Baseball swing"** - The flatter, around-the-body motion of a baseball swing naturally promotes a draw.

4. **"Hit the inside of the ball"** - Visualize making contact with the inside quadrant of the ball.

## Practicing Your Draw

### Alignment Stick Drill
Place an alignment stick on the ground pointing slightly right of target. Practice swinging along this line.

### Gate Drill
Set up two tees just wider than your clubhead, positioned so the only way through is with an in-to-out path.

### Gradual Curve Drill
Start by hitting slight draws, then gradually increase the curve. This builds control.

## When to Use a Draw

The draw is valuable for:
- **Dogleg left holes** - Work the ball around the corner
- **Right-to-left wind** - Helps fight the wind
- **Reaching par 5s in two** - The extra roll helps
- **Tight tee shots** - The predictable curve reduces risk

## Final Thoughts

A draw isn't just for show - it's a functional shot that adds distance and control to your game. Start with the fundamentals: slightly stronger grip, body aligned right, face at target, and an in-to-out path with a full release.

Practice with purpose, and that right-to-left ball flight will become a reliable part of your arsenal.
