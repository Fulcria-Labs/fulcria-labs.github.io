Bunker shots terrify most recreational golfers. Yet tour pros often *prefer* the sand to a tight lie in the rough. The difference isn't talent—it's technique and understanding.

**The bunker shot is actually the most forgiving shot in golf, if you know the secret: you don't hit the ball at all.**

## The Fundamental Concept

Unlike every other shot in golf, a greenside bunker shot is designed to NOT contact the ball. Instead:

1. The club enters the sand 1-2 inches behind the ball
2. The sand launches the ball out
3. The cushion of sand makes precise contact unnecessary

This is why pros prefer bunkers to tight lies—there's a margin for error that doesn't exist elsewhere.

## Setup: The Foundation

Proper setup creates 80% of bunker success:

### Stance
- **Open your stance** 20-30 degrees left of target (for right-handers)
- **Widen your base** slightly for stability in sand
- **Dig your feet in** an inch or two for solid footing
- **Ball position** slightly forward of center

### Club
- **Open the clubface first**, then grip
- The face should point at the sky when you look down
- Use your sand wedge (54-58 degrees)

### Weight
- **60-40 weight favoring front foot**
- Keep it there throughout the swing
- This pre-sets the low point ahead of the ball

## The Swing: Splash, Don't Dig

The goal is to slide the club *under* the ball, not dig into the sand.

### Key Moves

1. **Swing along your feet line** (not at the target). Your open stance handles the direction.

2. **Enter the sand 1-2 inches behind the ball.** Focus on a spot in the sand, not the ball.

3. **Accelerate through.** The biggest amateur mistake is decelerating—swing through the sand, not into it.

4. **Keep your chest rotating.** The shot needs body turn, not just arms.

5. **Finish high.** A full finish ensures you didn't quit on the shot.

### The Splash Feel

Imagine you're throwing the sand—and the ball riding on top of it—onto the green. It's a splash, not a stab.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Hitting the ball first
If you thin it over the green, you made contact with the ball. Focus on the sand behind it.

### 2. Decelerating
Fear causes golfers to slow down through impact. Commit to the swing—the sand provides resistance, so you need speed.

### 3. Digging too deep
Taking too much sand costs distance. Skim the surface rather than excavating. Think "splash" not "shovel."

### 4. Ball position too far back
This encourages a steep, diggy swing. Keep it forward of center.

### 5. Closed clubface
If you forget to open the face, you remove the club's bounce—the design feature that helps it slide through sand.

## Understanding Bounce

Your sand wedge has "bounce"—the angle between the leading edge and the bottom of the club. This bounce is designed to:

- Prevent the club from digging
- Allow the club to skim through sand
- Make bunker shots forgiving

When you open the clubface, you expose more bounce, making the club glide easier. This is why setup matters so much.

## Distance Control

The bunker shot scales differently than other shots:

- **Short bunker shot:** Smaller swing, same tempo
- **Medium shot:** Standard technique
- **Long bunker shot:** Less open face, fuller swing
- **Very long (fairway bunker):** Different technique entirely—pick it clean

For greenside bunkers within 20 yards, the standard splash technique handles most situations. Adjust swing length, not swing speed.

## Practice Strategy

### The Line Drill
Draw a line in the sand. Practice making your club enter on that line—no ball needed. Get consistent before adding a ball.

### Dollar Bill Visualization
Imagine a dollar bill under the ball. Your goal is to remove the entire bill with your swing.

### No-Look Practice
Once comfortable, try hitting bunker shots without looking at the ball—focus only on your entry point in the sand. This reinforces that the ball is not your target.

## Wet vs. Dry Sand

Conditions change your approach:

**Soft, fluffy sand:**
- Standard technique
- Ball comes out high and soft
- Take slightly more sand

**Wet, packed sand:**
- Close the clubface slightly
- Less bounce needed
- Hit closer to the ball
- Ball comes out lower and runs

## Mental Approach

Bunker shots require commitment. Fear breeds deceleration, which causes the very failures you're afraid of.

Instead:
- Accept that bunkers are part of golf
- Trust the technique
- Commit to acceleration
- Expect success

Once you've hit a few successful bunker shots, fear fades. The technique is reliable—confidence comes from reps.

## Video Analysis for Bunkers

While bunker technique is harder to analyze than a full swing, recording your practice sessions can reveal:

- Whether your club enters behind the ball
- If you're decelerating through impact
- Your finish position and body rotation

## Key Takeaways

1. **You're hitting the sand, not the ball.** This fundamental shift changes everything.

2. **Setup determines success.** Open stance, open face, weight forward.

3. **Accelerate through.** Never quit on a bunker shot.

4. **Use the bounce.** Open the face to expose the club's design feature.

5. **Splash, don't dig.** Think of throwing sand and ball together onto the green.

The bunker shot becomes your friend once you understand it. The margin for error is actually larger than most fairway shots—you just need to trust the technique and commit.

Practice the line drill, build confidence, and watch those double-bogey bunker disasters turn into routine up-and-downs.
