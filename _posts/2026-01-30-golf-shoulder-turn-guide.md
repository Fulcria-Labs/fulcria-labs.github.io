# Golf Shoulder Turn: Creating Width and Power in Your Backswing

A full shoulder turn is the foundation of a powerful golf swing. It creates the coil, stores energy, and gives you the width needed to generate clubhead speed. Yet many golfers struggle to achieve a complete shoulder turn, leaving distance on the table with every shot.

The good news: proper shoulder turn isn't about flexibility. It's about technique, setup, and understanding what actually needs to rotate.

## What Is a Proper Shoulder Turn?

At the top of your backswing, your lead shoulder should rotate under your chin. For right-handed golfers, your left shoulder moves toward where your right shoulder was at address. The ideal shoulder turn is approximately 90 degrees relative to your target line.

But here's what most golfers get wrong: they measure shoulder turn by looking at their arms. A full shoulder turn isn't about getting your hands high. It's about rotating your chest and upper back away from the target.

Place a club across your chest and make a backswing motion. Your chest should face away from the target at the top. If the club points at the ball or inside it, you haven't made a full turn.

## The Shoulder-Hip Relationship

Your shoulders need to turn more than your hips. This creates the X-factor we talked about in our hip rotation guide. While your hips rotate roughly 45 degrees, your shoulders should rotate closer to 90 degrees.

This differential creates torque in your core muscles. Think of it like twisting a rubber band. The more differential between your upper and lower body, the more energy you store. When you unwind, that stored energy releases into the ball.

Golfers who rotate their shoulders and hips together lose this energy storage. They end up with an "all arms" swing that lacks power and consistency.

## Why Golfers Struggle With Shoulder Turn

### Limited Mobility

Modern life isn't kind to shoulder mobility. Hours at desks, driving, and looking at phones create tight chest muscles and weak upper back muscles. This postural pattern restricts your ability to rotate your thoracic spine.

The fix isn't forcing a bigger turn. It's improving mobility off the course. Simple stretches and exercises can add 10-15 degrees to your shoulder turn within weeks.

### Wrong Setup

Your stance width affects your shoulder turn. Too wide a stance restricts hip rotation, which limits how far your shoulders can go. If you're struggling to turn, try narrowing your stance slightly.

Ball position matters too. If the ball is too far forward, you'll set up with your shoulders open, making a full turn feel impossible.

### Swaying Instead of Rotating

Many golfers move their body laterally instead of rotating. They slide away from the target, thinking they're making a turn. But lateral movement isn't rotation. Your head should stay relatively centered while your shoulders rotate around your spine.

A good checkpoint: at the top of your backswing, your head should be in approximately the same position as at address. If it's moved significantly toward your back foot, you're swaying, not turning.

### Lifting Instead of Turning

When golfers can't turn their shoulders, they compensate by lifting their arms. The hands get high, but there's no coil. This creates a narrow, weak backswing that produces inconsistent strikes.

If your arms are doing the work, your body isn't. Focus on rotating your chest, and let your arms go along for the ride.

## The Proper Sequence

### Step 1: Initiate With Your Lead Shoulder

The takeaway starts with your lead shoulder turning away from the target. Your arms, hands, and club follow this motion. Don't start by picking the club up or manipulating it with your hands.

Feel like your sternum is rotating away from the ball. Your lead shoulder moves down and around while your trail shoulder moves up and back.

### Step 2: Maintain Connection

Your arms stay connected to your body throughout the turn. Your lead arm stays relatively straight (not locked, but not bent either). The triangle formed by your arms and chest at address should stay intact as you turn.

### Step 3: Complete the Turn

At the top, your lead shoulder should be under your chin. Your back should face the target. Your lead arm should be roughly parallel to the ground for a full swing.

Don't rush to start the downswing. A complete turn takes time. Amateur golfers often cut their backswing short because they're eager to hit the ball.

## Drills for Better Shoulder Turn

### The Chair Drill

Sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Cross your arms over your chest. Now rotate your shoulders as far as you can while keeping your hips relatively still.

This isolates your thoracic rotation without letting your hips compensate. If you can't rotate much, you've identified a mobility limitation to work on.

Practice this rotation for 30 seconds each direction, twice a day. You'll see improvement within a week.

### The Wall Drill

Stand with your back against a wall. Address an imaginary ball. Now try to touch the wall with your lead shoulder while keeping your trail shoulder off the wall.

This teaches the proper shoulder plane and prevents the common mistake of tilting instead of turning.

### The Pause Drill

Make your normal backswing, but pause for a full second at the top. Check your positions: Is your lead shoulder under your chin? Is your chest facing away from the target? Can you feel the coil in your core?

This pause gives you feedback on whether you're actually achieving a full turn.

### The Alignment Stick Across Shoulders

Place an alignment stick across your shoulders, behind your neck. Make practice swings and watch where the stick points at the top of your backswing. It should point at or behind the ball.

This visual feedback is invaluable for feeling a true shoulder turn versus an arms-only swing.

## Flexibility Exercises for Better Turn

### Thoracic Spine Rotation

Get on all fours. Place one hand behind your head. Rotate that elbow toward the ceiling, following it with your eyes. Hold for two seconds, then return. Do 10 repetitions each side.

### Open Book Stretch

Lie on your side with knees bent 90 degrees. Extend your arms in front of you, palms together. Rotate your top arm across your body, opening up like a book. Keep your knees together throughout.

### Cat-Cow Stretches

On all fours, alternate between arching your back (cat) and dropping your belly (cow). This loosens the entire spine and improves rotation capacity.

Do these exercises daily. Within two weeks, you should notice an easier, fuller shoulder turn.

## Common Questions

### How Much Shoulder Turn Do I Really Need?

It depends on your flexibility and age. Tour players average 90+ degrees. But a 75-degree turn with proper sequencing beats a 90-degree turn with poor technique every time.

Focus on quality over quantity. A complete, connected turn at whatever angle your body allows beats forcing extra rotation that breaks your swing.

### Should My Shoulder Turn Feel Tight?

You should feel stretched but not strained. There should be tension in your core muscles as your shoulders outpace your hips. But pain or extreme tightness suggests you're forcing something your body isn't ready for.

### Can I Make a Full Turn With a Bad Back?

Consult a doctor first. But many golfers with back issues actually improve when they learn to rotate properly. The issue often isn't the turn itself, but compensations that put stress on the lower back.

## Putting It Together

Your shoulder turn is the engine of your backswing. It creates width, stores energy, and sets up everything that follows. Without a proper turn, you're fighting your swing instead of flowing with it.

Start with the chair drill to assess your current mobility. Work on the flexibility exercises daily. Use the alignment stick drill to feel what a real shoulder turn feels like.

Most golfers see significant improvement within two to three weeks of focused practice. The shoulder turn isn't complicated, but it does require intention and repetition to groove.

Record your swing from behind. Check that your lead shoulder passes under your chin at the top. Verify that your back faces the target. These visual checkpoints confirm you're building the foundation for a powerful, repeatable swing.

Your distance is limited by your turn. Unlock a fuller shoulder rotation, and you'll unlock yards you didn't know you had.
