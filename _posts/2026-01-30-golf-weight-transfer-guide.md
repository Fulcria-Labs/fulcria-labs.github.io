# Golf Weight Transfer: The Foundation of Power and Consistency

You can have perfect grip, ideal stance, and textbook positions throughout your swing. But if your weight doesn't move correctly, you're leaving distance on the table and inviting inconsistency into every shot.

Weight transfer is what separates powerful, repeatable swings from arms-only swipes at the ball. It's how professional golfers generate clubhead speeds over 110 mph while looking effortless. And it's likely the missing piece in your game.

## What Is Weight Transfer in Golf?

Weight transfer is the deliberate shifting of your body weight between your trail foot (right foot for right-handed golfers) and lead foot throughout the swing. Think of it as loading and unloading energy.

Golf is a rotational sport. Like a pitcher winding up to throw or a boxer loading a punch, you need to shift weight backward to create the conditions for explosive forward movement.

## The 75/25 Rule

Here's the simple framework:

**At address**: Weight is roughly 50/50 between both feet, or slightly favoring the trail foot for driver

**Top of backswing**: About 75% of your weight on the trail foot, 25% on the lead foot

**At impact**: About 80% of your weight on the lead foot, 20% on the trail foot

**Finish**: Nearly 100% on the lead foot, trail heel off the ground

These percentages aren't exact prescriptions. They're reference points. The key concept is this: load into the trail foot going back, fire through the lead foot coming down.

## Weight Shift vs Body Sway: The Critical Difference

This distinction trips up countless golfers.

Weight transfer does not mean swaying your body toward the target or away from it. Your head should stay relatively centered. Your spine angle should remain stable.

Instead, think of weight transfer as pressure moving through your feet. You're loading into the inside of your trail foot on the backswing, then driving that pressure toward your lead foot in the downswing.

If you sway laterally during the backswing, you've moved your body when you should have moved your weight. This leads to thin shots, topped balls, and the dreaded reverse pivot.

## The Reverse Pivot: Golf's Biggest Weight Transfer Mistake

The reverse pivot happens when a golfer does the opposite of proper weight transfer. They lean toward the target on the backswing (weight on lead foot) and fall away from the target on the downswing (weight on trail foot).

Signs you have a reverse pivot:
- Feeling off-balance at the top of your swing
- Impact feeling weak despite swinging hard
- Hitting behind the ball frequently
- Finishing with weight on your back foot

The reverse pivot is especially common among golfers who've been told to "keep your head still." They interpret this as keeping their body frozen, which prevents natural weight transfer.

## The Downswing Trigger

The transition from backswing to downswing is where weight transfer gets most critical. Here's the sequence that matters:

The lower body initiates the downswing by shifting weight toward the lead foot. This happens before the hands start down. Your hips begin firing toward the target while your arms and club are still completing the backswing.

This is often called the "magic move." The lower body leads, creating a separation between upper and lower body that stores tremendous energy.

By the time your hands reach hip height in the downswing, most of your weight should already be on your lead foot. If you're still balanced 50/50 at this point, you're late.

## Drills to Improve Weight Transfer

### Step Drill
Hit balls with your feet together, then step toward the target with your lead foot during the downswing. This teaches your body the proper sequence and timing.

### Pressure Pad Awareness
Practice with focus on feeling pressure in your feet. On the backswing, feel the inside of your trail foot load up. On the downswing, feel the ground pushing back up through your lead leg.

### Slow Motion Swings
Make swings at half speed, pausing at the top to check your weight distribution. Can you lift your lead foot off the ground slightly? You should be able to if weight is properly loaded.

### The Step Back Drill
Start with your feet close together. As you begin your backswing, step your trail foot back. As you transition, step your lead foot toward the target. This exaggerates the weight transfer motion.

## Common Weight Transfer Mistakes

**Starting with too much weight forward**: If you set up with weight already on your lead foot, you have nowhere to load. Start balanced.

**Not completing the shift forward**: Many golfers load into the trail foot fine but never fully commit to the lead foot on the downswing. The forward shift creates speed.

**Swaying instead of turning**: Lateral movement wastes energy. Rotational movement with proper weight shift creates it.

**Rushing the transition**: The downswing weight shift should feel like a powerful push, not a panicked lunge. Timing matters as much as movement.

## How Video Analysis Helps

Weight transfer problems are hard to feel but easy to see. Video analysis from a face-on angle reveals:

- Whether you're swaying laterally or rotating properly
- How much weight is on each foot at key positions
- If your transition sequence is correct
- Whether you're finishing balanced on your lead foot

Modern swing analyzers can even measure pressure distribution throughout the swing, giving you objective data about where your weight actually is versus where you think it is.

## The Power Connection

Proper weight transfer is how golfers generate club head speed without swinging harder. When you load into your trail side and then drive through your lead side, you're using the ground as leverage.

Think about jumping. You can't jump high starting from a standing position without loading first. You bend your knees, shift your weight, and explode upward. The golf swing works the same way.

Professional golfers create "ground reaction force" by pushing against the ground through their legs. This force travels up through the kinetic chain and into the club. It's efficient physics, not brute strength.

## Practice Plan

**Week 1-2**: Focus on feeling weight distribution at address and top of backswing. Use the slow motion drill to develop awareness.

**Week 3-4**: Work on the transition. Practice starting the downswing with lower body weight shift before your arms move.

**Week 5-6**: Integrate with full swings. Hit balls focusing on finishing balanced on your lead foot with your belt buckle facing the target.

**Ongoing**: Record your swing regularly to verify weight transfer is happening correctly. What feels right isn't always what's actually happening.

## Key Takeaways

Weight transfer is the engine of the golf swing. Without it, you're limited to arm strength alone.

Load into your trail foot on the backswing. Drive through your lead foot on the downswing. Keep your head centered and avoid lateral sway. Start the downswing from the ground up.

Master these fundamentals and you'll hit the ball farther with less effort. That's the trade-off every golfer wants.
