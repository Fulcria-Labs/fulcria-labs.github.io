Watch any tour pro in slow motion and you'll see it: that angle between the lead arm and club shaft is preserved deep into the downswing. The club looks like it's "lagging" behind the hands. Then, right before impact, it releases with explosive speed.

That's lag. And it's why professional golfers hit the ball 50+ yards farther than most amateurs—without looking like they're swinging harder.

## What Lag Actually Is

Lag is the angle between your lead arm and the club shaft during the [downswing](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/). At the top of a good backswing, this angle is roughly 90 degrees from proper wrist hinge. Maintaining that angle as you start down is what creates lag.

Here's the key insight: lag isn't something you create. It's something you *preserve*.

During the backswing, your wrists naturally hinge as the club gets heavy. That creates the angle. The challenge is keeping that angle intact during the transition and early downswing, instead of losing it immediately.

When you maintain the angle, you store energy. When you release it at the right moment—just before impact—that stored energy transfers into the ball.

## Why Amateur Golfers Lose Lag

The natural human instinct is to hit *at* the ball. When you see the ball and want to hit it hard, your body wants to throw the club at it immediately from the top.

This is called "casting" or "early release." Instead of maintaining the wrist angle, you straighten your wrists right at the transition. The club releases too early, and all that stored energy dissipates before it reaches the ball.

Common causes of lost lag:

**1. Upper body starting first**

The proper [downswing sequence](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/) is ground-up: lower body, torso, arms, then club. When your shoulders or arms initiate the downswing, the club tends to throw out immediately.

**2. "Hitting" instead of "swinging"**

The harder you try to hit the ball, the more you cast. Lag is actually easier to maintain when you swing at 80% effort with good sequence than when you swing all-out with bad sequence.

**3. Grip pressure**

Squeezing the club too tight prevents proper wrist hinge and makes early release more likely. A lighter grip allows the wrists to stay loaded longer.

**4. No awareness**

Many golfers don't realize they're losing lag. They feel like they're "swinging hard" and don't understand why they can't generate tour-like distance. [Video analysis](/blog/how-ai-analyzes-golf-swing/) reveals the truth.

## The Feeling of Good Lag

Lag doesn't feel like you're actively holding an angle. It feels like the club is trailing behind your hands naturally as your body rotates toward the target.

Some useful feels:

- **Pulling the grip end toward the ball.** Instead of throwing the clubhead at the ball, focus on pulling the handle. The head follows.

- **Keeping your back to the target longer.** This creates space for the club to drop into the slot instead of casting over the top.

- **Delayed hit.** Feel like you're not even thinking about the ball until your hands are past hip height in the downswing.

None of these feels is literally what's happening, but they create the right motion for most golfers.

## Lag and Impact Position

Lag connects directly to [impact position](/blog/golf-impact-position/). When you maintain lag and release it at the right moment:

- Your hands arrive ahead of the clubhead
- The shaft leans forward toward the target
- You compress the ball with descending contact
- The clubhead reaches maximum speed right at impact—not before it

This is why lag produces both power and solid contact. The ball compresses against the face, and you get that satisfying "click" that means you hit it pure.

Golfers who cast lose both benefits. The club passes the hands before impact, the shaft leans backward, and contact becomes scoopy and thin.

## How to Build Lag: Drills That Work

### 1. The Pump Drill

Start at the top of your backswing. Pump the club down to hip height while maintaining your wrist angle, then go back to the top. Do this three times, then hit the ball on the fourth pump.

This trains your body to sequence correctly: lower body first, arms and club following.

### 2. The Pause at the Top

Make a full backswing, then pause for a full second at the top. Feel your lower body start the downswing while your arms and club are still at the top.

This exaggerates the sequence separation that creates lag naturally.

### 3. Half-Speed Swings with Full Finish

Swing at 50% speed but focus on finishing in a full, balanced position. At half speed, you can feel the sequence better. Your hands should be well past hip height before you feel the club release.

Record these swings. You'll see more lag at half speed than at full speed—that tells you what to work on.

### 4. The Glove Under the Arm Drill

Tuck a glove or headcover under your lead armpit. Make swings where it stays tucked through impact. This prevents your arms from flying away from your body early, which is often connected to casting.

### 5. Towel Whip Drill

Swing a towel like a golf club. To make the end "crack" like a whip, you can't throw it from the top—you have to sequence properly and let the end accelerate late.

This teaches the feel of stored and released energy without a club.

## What to Look for in Video

When you [record your swing](/blog/phone-golf-swing-video/), freeze the video at these checkpoints:

**Transition (just starting down):**
- The wrist angle should be similar to what it was at the top
- Your hips should already be open (started rotating) while your shoulders are still relatively closed

**Hands at hip height (downswing):**
- Look at the angle between your lead arm and the club shaft
- Tour pros still have 70-90 degrees of lag here
- Amateurs often have almost no angle left—the club has already straightened

**At impact:**
- Hands should be ahead of the clubhead
- Shaft leans toward the target
- The wrist angle has released fully (the energy has been delivered)

## Common Lag Myths

**Myth: You should feel like you're "holding" the lag.**

Reality: Trying to hold the angle usually creates tension and awkward timing. Better players feel like they're swinging freely, and lag happens naturally from good sequence.

**Myth: More lag is always better.**

Reality: There's an optimal amount. Too much lag can actually cause timing issues and inconsistent contact. Focus on sequence, not maximizing the angle.

**Myth: Lag requires a specific wrist condition.**

Reality: Good lag comes from sequence and timing, not a particular wrist position. Both flat and slightly cupped lead wrists can produce excellent lag.

## The Real Secret: It's About Sequence

Lag is a result, not a cause. You don't create lag by focusing on your wrists. You create lag by:

1. Making a proper backswing with natural wrist hinge
2. Starting the downswing from the ground up
3. Letting your arms and club trail your body rotation
4. Not trying to hit the ball—letting the release happen naturally

When the sequence is right, lag appears automatically. When you try to manufacture it, you usually make things worse.

That's why [video analysis](/blog/best-golf-swing-analyzer-app/) is so valuable for working on lag. You can't feel what's actually happening in fractions of a second. But you can see it, frame by frame, and train the right patterns.
