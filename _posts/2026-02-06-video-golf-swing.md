![Why Video Changed My Golf Game (And Why It'll Change Yours)](/assets/images/video-golf-swing.png)
I played golf for 15 years before I first recorded my swing. What I saw shocked me.

My "pause at the top"? Non-existent. My "inside takeaway"? Actually outside. My "steady head"? Moving six inches.

Everything I thought I was doing was wrong. And I had no idea.

## The Feel vs. Real Problem

Golf is one of the few sports where what you feel doesn't match what's real. You can make a swing that feels completely different but looks nearly identical on video.

Tour pros know this. That's why every practice session includes video. They've learned not to trust feel alone.

Amateur golfers spend years grooving bad habits because they've never verified what their swing actually looks like.

## What to Film

### Angle 1: Down the Line (Behind You)

- Club path (inside/outside)
- Plane angle
- Head movement
- Extension through impact

### Angle 2: Face On (In Front)

- Weight shift
- Hip rotation
- Arm structure at impact
- Posture throughout swing

**You need both angles to get the full picture.** Each reveals different information.

## How to Set Up Video

**Phone position:**

- Down the line: camera at hand height, pointing at the ball
- Face on: camera at waist height, centered on your body

**Distance:** 8-10 feet away

**Frame rate:** Most phones default to 30fps. Switch to 120fps or 240fps if available - slow motion reveals details impossible to see at normal speed.

## What to Look For

Start with the basics:

1. Where is your club at the top of the backswing?
2. What direction is the shaft moving in transition?
3. Where is your clubhead at impact relative to your hands?
4. What's your body position at finish?

Compare these positions to what you intended. **The gap between intention and reality is your improvement opportunity.**

## The Feedback Loop

Video creates a feedback loop that accelerates learning:

1. Film your swing
2. Identify one issue
3. Feel a correction
4. Film again
5. Compare before/after

This loop - execute, observe, adjust - is how all motor skills develop. Without the "observe" step, you're practicing blindly.

## From Video to AI Analysis

Raw video shows you what's happening but not always why it matters or how to fix it.

AI swing analyzers add a layer of interpretation:

- What specific issues exist in your swing
- Which issues matter most
- What drills address those issues
- How you compare to your previous swings

Think of it as having a swing coach review every video you take.

## Getting Started Today

You don't need fancy equipment. Your smartphone is enough. Start filming every practice session and watch with honest eyes.

The gap between feel and real might surprise you. But seeing the truth is the first step to actually improving.
