Most golfers' range sessions are wasted effort. They dump a bucket of balls, aim at the 150 marker, and mindlessly hit until the bucket's empty. Zero improvement.

Here's a 90-second routine that builds real skills in minimal time.

## Why 90 Seconds?

Attention and intention matter more than volume. Research on motor learning shows that focused, deliberate practice beats mindless repetition by a factor of 10.

**One intentional swing with clear focus beats 10 autopilot swings.**

## The Routine

### 10 seconds: Pick ONE focus

Not two things. One. Examples:

- Keep my head still through impact
- Feel my weight shift to front foot
- Pause at the top of my backswing

### 20 seconds: Visualize the shot

See the ball flight in your mind. Where's it starting? What shape is it taking? Where's it landing?

### 10 seconds: Practice swing

One rehearsal swing focusing on your key thought.

### 10 seconds: Execute

Hit the ball with the same intention.

### 40 seconds: Evaluate

What happened? Did you achieve your focus? What was the result?

Don't immediately hit another ball. **The learning happens in the evaluation.**

## Building a Session

Repeat this 90-second cycle 10 times = 15 minutes of focused practice.

That's more valuable than an hour of mindless hitting.

## The Secret Weapon: Video

Filming your swing adds accountability. You can't lie to yourself when there's video proof.

Between shots, watch your previous swing. Did you actually do what you intended? Often we think we made a change but the video shows otherwise.
