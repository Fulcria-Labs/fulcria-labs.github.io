# How to Fix a Golf Hook: The Better Player's Problem (Solved)

Here's something most people won't tell you: if you're hooking the ball, you're a better golfer than someone who slices.

That might not feel true when your tee shot dives left into the trees. But hooks happen because you're doing some things right: you're rotating through the ball, creating clubhead speed, and releasing the club. You're just doing them a little too much.

The hook is fixable. And the swing that creates it, once refined, becomes a consistent draw.

## What Causes a Hook?

A hook happens when the clubface is closed relative to your swing path at impact. The ball starts where the face points, then curves in the direction the path is traveling relative to the face.

For a right-handed golfer, a hook starts slightly right (or straight) then curves hard left. That curve means:
- Your clubface was closed to your path
- Your path was likely in-to-out
- The combination created heavy sidespin

The more closed your face, the more severe the hook. The more in-to-out your path, the lower the ball launches and the harder it dives.

Understanding this relationship is the key to fixing it.

## Step 1: Check Your Grip

The grip is the first place to look. A strong grip, where both hands are rotated too far clockwise on the club (for righties), pre-sets the face in a closed position.

Here's the check: at address, look down at your left hand. How many knuckles do you see?

- **Two knuckles**: Neutral grip
- **Three or more knuckles**: Strong grip
- **V's pointed at right shoulder or beyond**: Too strong

If your grip is too strong, even a perfect swing delivers a closed face at impact. The fix is simple but will feel strange: weaken your grip by rotating both hands counterclockwise until you see only two knuckles on your left hand. The V's formed by your thumbs and forefingers should point between your chin and right shoulder.

This change will feel uncomfortable at first. You might feel like the club could fly out of your hands. That's normal. Practice with it before judging the results.

## Step 2: Check Your Ball Position

When the ball is too far back in your stance, you catch it before your swing arc has neutralized. Your path is still moving right (in-to-out), and your face is closing but hasn't squared up yet.

For irons, the ball should be roughly in the center of your stance or slightly forward. For driver, position it off your lead heel.

A quick test: set up to a ball and place an alignment stick on the ground along your toe line. Drop a second stick from the ball to the ground. Is the ball behind center? Move it forward and see what happens to your ball flight.

## Step 3: Check Your Alignment

It sounds counterintuitive, but golfers who hook often aim right to compensate. This makes the problem worse.

When you aim right, you swing even more in-to-out to get the ball back to target. Your path becomes more extreme, requiring an even faster release to square the face. That leads to snap hooks, the violent left curve that happens when everything fires together.

Set up two alignment sticks: one along your feet, one along your target line. Are they parallel? Most hookers will find their feet aimed right of target. Square them up and resist the urge to aim right.

## Step 4: Quiet Your Hands

Hooks often come from overactive hands through impact. You're actively rotating your forearms and closing the face, rather than letting the rotation happen naturally.

The fix: feel like your hands stay passive through impact while your body does the work. Your lead arm should feel like it's pulling through toward the target, keeping the face from closing too quickly.

One drill that helps: hit shots with a light grip pressure. Rate your normal grip a 10. Try hitting at a 4. The lighter pressure makes it harder to manipulate the face with your hands.

Another drill: hit punch shots. Take a three-quarter backswing and finish with your hands at chest height. This limits the time your hands have to rotate and promotes a more stable face through impact.

## Step 5: Address Your Path

If your path is too far in-to-out, the ball will curve right to left regardless of face adjustments. You need to bring your path closer to neutral.

The feeling: instead of swinging out to right field, swing more toward the pitcher's mound. Your hands should feel like they're moving more left through impact.

A helpful drill: place a headcover or small object about a foot outside your ball and slightly forward. During your downswing, miss the object to the left. This trains your path to be more out-to-in (or at least neutral) rather than severely in-to-out.

Be careful not to overdo this. Overcorrection creates a slice or pull. The goal is neutral, not the opposite extreme.

## Step 6: Rotate Through the Shot

One common hook cause: the body stalls and the hands take over.

When your rotation stops through impact, your hands keep going. They flip, the face closes, and the ball hooks. The solution is to keep turning.

At the finish, your belt buckle should face the target, your weight should be on your lead foot, and your chest should be pointing left of target (for righties). If you're finishing with your body facing right of target, you're not rotating enough.

A helpful feel: imagine your body is trying to outrace your hands to the target. Keep turning through the ball, and the face stays more stable.

## The Real-Time Feedback Advantage

The tricky thing about fixing a hook is that changes feel massive but often appear subtle on video.

That grip change you made? It might only be a quarter-inch different. That path shift? Barely visible. But the ball flight difference is dramatic.

This is why real-time feedback matters. When you can see your swing on video, measure your path, and track your face angle, you know if your changes are actually happening or just feeling different.

Trust what you see, not just what you feel.

## From Hook to Controlled Draw

The goal isn't to eliminate curve entirely. The goal is to control it.

A controlled draw, where the ball starts slightly right and curves back to target, is often called the "ideal" ball flight. It maximizes distance, rides the wind well, and rolls out on landing.

You already have the building blocks for this shot. Your release is active. Your path moves in-to-out. You just need to reduce the extremes.

When your grip is neutral, your ball position is forward, your alignment is square, your hands are quiet, your path is moderate, and your body rotates fully, the hook becomes a draw.

Same swing, refined. That's the difference between a hook and a weapon.

## Quick Fixes for the Course

When a hook shows up mid-round, you don't have time for swing changes. Here are quick adjustments:

**Weaken your grip slightly.** Even a small adjustment can neutralize the face.

**Move the ball forward an inch.** Gives the face more time to open before impact.

**Swing at 80%.** Slower swings give you more control over face and path.

**Aim left of target.** Not ideal long-term, but it accounts for the curve.

**Think "hold the face open."** Feel like you're keeping the logo on your glove pointing skyward longer through impact.

These aren't permanent fixes. They're bandages that keep your score together until you can work on the range.

## The Upside of Being a Hooker

Strange but true: hooking means you're athletic. You're creating clubhead speed. You're releasing properly. You're doing things that many golfers struggle to learn.

The fix isn't to swing differently. It's to refine what you already do. Small adjustments, consistently applied, turn a hook into a draw, a draw into your stock shot.

That's the progression. And it's a progression that leads to better golf.
