It is February. The ground is frozen, the range is closed, and your clubs are collecting dust in the garage. Sound familiar?

Here is the good news: you do not need a driving range, a simulator, or even a backyard to keep your golf swing sharp. The best golf swing drills at home require nothing more than a club, a mirror, and about 20 minutes of focused effort. Some do not even need a club.

Tour pros have known this for years. Much of their real swing work happens off the course -- in hotel rooms, basements, and living rooms. The absence of a ball actually helps you focus on feel and positions instead of chasing results.

Whether you are waiting out winter or just want to squeeze in practice before work, these 12 drills will keep your swing ready for the moment you step back on the course.

## Why Golf Swing Drills at Home Actually Work

There is a common belief that you can only improve by hitting balls. Research says otherwise.

Motor learning studies show that slow, deliberate repetition of movement patterns builds stronger neural pathways than full-speed repetition. In other words, your brain learns positions and sequences better when you slow down and pay attention -- exactly the kind of practice you can do indoors.

Home drills also eliminate the biggest distraction at the range: ball flight. When you are not watching where the ball goes, you can focus 100% on how the swing feels. That internal awareness is what separates golfers who plateau from golfers who keep improving.

## What You Need (Almost Nothing)

Before we get into the drills, here is your equipment list:

- **A golf club** (a 7-iron or wedge works best)
- **A full-length mirror** or a window that shows your reflection
- **A towel or small pillow**
- **An alignment stick** (or a broomstick)
- **Your phone** for recording

That is it. Total cost if you own a club: zero.

## Full Swing Drills

### 1. The Slow Motion Swing (The Foundation Drill)

This is the single most effective drill you can do anywhere, and it costs nothing.

**How to do it:**
- Take your normal setup with a club
- Make a full swing at roughly 20% of your normal speed
- A full swing should take 15-20 seconds from start to finish
- Pause at the top for 2 seconds, then at impact for 2 seconds

**What to feel for:** Smooth [weight transfer](/blog/golf-weight-transfer/) from your trail foot to your lead foot. Your hips opening before your arms drop. The sensation of the club "lagging" behind your body rotation.

**Do 10 reps.** You will be surprised how tiring this is. Slow motion forces your stabilizer muscles to work overtime, and that builds real swing strength.

### 2. The Feet Together Drill (No Ball Needed)

You have probably heard of this one at the range. It works even better at home without a ball.

**How to do it:**
- Bring your feet together so they are touching
- Make smooth, controlled swings at about 50% effort
- Focus on rotation rather than any side-to-side movement

**Why it matters:** With a narrow base, your body cannot sway. You are forced to turn. This drill trains proper rotation and [balance](/blog/golf-balance-drills/) in a way that transfers directly to your full swing. Start with half swings and work up to three-quarter swings over a few sessions.

### 3. The Pause at the Top Drill

Rushing the transition from backswing to downswing is one of the most common faults in amateur golf. This drill directly targets it.

**How to do it:**
- Make your normal backswing
- Stop completely at the top and hold for a full 3 seconds
- Start the downswing with your lower body, letting the arms follow
- Swing through to a full finish

**What to watch for:** During the pause, check that your weight has shifted to the inside of your trail foot. Your lead arm should be relatively straight. Your shoulders should be turned more than your hips. If you are in front of a mirror, you can verify all three.

**Do 15 reps.** The goal is to make the pause feel natural so that in real swings, you develop a smoother [transition](/blog/golf-swing-transition-guide/).

### 4. The Towel Under the Arm Drill

This is a classic for a reason -- it trains connection between your arms and body.

**How to do it:**
- Tuck a small towel or glove under your lead armpit
- Make half to three-quarter swings without dropping the towel
- Focus on turning your chest rather than lifting your arms

**Why it works:** If the towel falls out, your arms are separating from your body -- a common cause of inconsistency, slices, and thin shots. Keeping the towel in place forces your arms and torso to move as one unit, which is how every good swing works.

### 5. The Wall Touch Drill (Hip Rotation)

Many golfers struggle with [hip rotation](/blog/golf-hip-rotation/) because they either slide their hips laterally or do not rotate them enough. This drill gives you instant feedback.

**How to do it:**
- Stand with your trail hip about 6 inches from a wall
- Take your golf posture (no club needed)
- Make a backswing turn -- your trail hip should gently touch the wall
- Now start the downswing -- rotate your lead hip back until it touches the wall behind you

**The key:** Your hips should rotate, not slide. If you feel your whole body shifting toward the wall, you are swaying. The goal is a pivoting motion around a centered axis.

**Do 20 reps on each side.** This drill builds the feel of rotational power that adds distance to every club.

## Short Game Drills

### 6. The Carpet Chip

You do not need a chipping green to develop soft hands.

**How to do it:**
- Use a wedge and foam practice balls (or even rolled-up socks)
- Set up a target -- a bucket, a towel on the floor, a couch cushion
- Hit small chip shots from 5-15 feet, varying the target distance

**Focus on:** Keeping your hands ahead of the clubhead through impact. A descending strike. Quiet wrists. The feel of the bounce interacting with the carpet.

Even without real balls, this drill sharpens your hand-eye coordination and distance control. Twenty chips a day adds up to over 600 a month -- that kind of volume transforms your short game.

### 7. The Putting Gate Drill

Putting is the easiest part of your game to practice at home, and it has the most direct impact on your scores.

**How to do it:**
- Set up two tees or coins about one putter-head-width apart
- Place them 3 feet from a target (a cup, a table leg, a piece of tape on the floor)
- Stroke putts through the gate without hitting either marker

**Why it matters:** This trains a square face at impact and a consistent stroke path -- the two fundamentals that control putting accuracy. Once you can roll 20 in a row through the gate from 3 feet, move back to 5 feet.

### 8. The One-Handed Chip Drill

This is a feel drill that does wonders for your touch around the greens.

**How to do it:**
- Hold a wedge in your trail hand only
- Make small chipping motions, letting the club swing naturally
- Then switch to your lead hand only
- Finally, combine both hands and notice how much smoother the motion feels

**What it builds:** Each hand has a different job. The trail hand controls the clubface. The lead hand guides the swing path. Training them separately and then together gives you a level of short game feel that hours of regular practice cannot match.

## No-Club Drills

### 9. The Chair Rotation Drill

This drill builds rotational mobility and teaches proper sequencing -- and you can do it while watching television.

**How to do it:**
- Sit on the edge of a sturdy chair with your feet flat on the floor
- Cross your arms over your chest
- Rotate your upper body to the right as far as you comfortably can, then to the left
- Keep your hips relatively still and your lower body quiet

**Do 3 sets of 15 rotations each direction.** Over time, you will notice your range of motion increasing. More rotation means more power and a fuller backswing without straining.

### 10. The Underhand Ball Toss

This one develops the feel of proper release through impact.

**How to do it:**
- Take your normal golf stance, holding a tennis ball in your trail hand
- Make a small backswing motion and then "throw" the ball underhand toward a target on the ground about 10 feet in front of you
- The ball should release from your hand at roughly where the golf ball would be in your stance

**Why it works:** The underhand toss mirrors the release pattern of a good golf swing. If you tend to cast the club or flip your wrists at impact, this drill helps you feel what a natural, athletic release is supposed to feel like.

### 11. The Alignment Stick Behind the Back

This drill checks your turn and shoulder plane, and it takes 30 seconds.

**How to do it:**
- Hold an alignment stick or broomstick behind your back, in the crooks of your elbows
- Take your golf posture
- Make a backswing turn -- the stick should point at the ground roughly in front of your trail foot
- Make a through-swing turn -- the stick should point at the ground in front of your lead foot

**What to check:** If the stick points straight down at the ground (too steep) or out toward the horizon (too flat), your shoulder plane needs adjusting. This visual feedback is immediate and easy to self-correct.

### 12. The Impact Position Drill

If there is one position in the golf swing that matters above all others, it is impact. This drill engrains the correct feel.

**How to do it:**
- Stand in your normal address position with or without a club
- Shift into your ideal impact position: weight 70-80% on your lead foot, hips slightly open, hands ahead of where the ball would be, lead wrist flat
- Hold this position for 5 seconds
- Return to address. Repeat.
- Then try flowing between address and impact at increasing speeds

**Do 20 reps.** You are training your body to find this position automatically. Once it becomes second nature, your ball striking will improve dramatically -- fewer [fat and thin shots](/blog/stop-fat-thin-shots/), more compression, and a more satisfying impact feel.

## How to Structure Your Home Practice

Random drilling is better than nothing, but a structured approach produces faster results. Here is a simple weekly plan:

| Day | Focus | Time | Drills |
|-----|-------|------|--------|
| Monday | Full swing | 20 min | Slow motion, pause at top, towel drill |
| Tuesday | Short game | 15 min | Carpet chip, putting gate, one-handed chip |
| Wednesday | Mobility | 10 min | Chair rotation, wall touch, alignment stick |
| Thursday | Full swing | 20 min | Feet together, impact position, slow motion |
| Friday | Short game | 15 min | Putting gate, carpet chip, underhand toss |
| Saturday | Film review | 15 min | Record drills and compare to previous weeks |
| Sunday | Rest | -- | -- |

That is roughly 90 minutes of focused practice per week. It is not a huge time commitment, but it is enough to maintain your swing through a long winter and even make real improvements.

## Film Your Home Drills

One of the most underrated aspects of home practice is how easy it is to film yourself. No wind, no distractions, consistent lighting. Prop your phone against a chair, hit record, and capture your drills from down the line and face on.

Then review the footage. Better yet, run your swing videos through [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) to get AI-powered feedback on your positions and sequencing. It works on practice swings just as well as full shots -- the analysis is measuring your body movement, not ball flight. That means your living room practice session gets the same quality feedback as a range session.

## The Payoff: Be Ready When Spring Arrives

Golfers who practice through winter do not just maintain their game -- they leap ahead of everyone who put their clubs away in November. Your [spring golf preparation](/blog/spring-golf-preparation-guide/) starts right now, in your living room, with these drills.

The advantage is real. While everyone else spends their first three rounds of the season shaking off rust, you will step onto the first tee with a swing that feels familiar and repeatable. That kind of confidence is worth more than any new driver.

Pick three drills from this list. Commit to 15 minutes a day. And when the snow melts, you will be glad you did.
