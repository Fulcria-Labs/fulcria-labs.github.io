Most amateur golfers dread bunker shots. They either skull the ball over the green or leave it in the sand. Yet for professionals, bunkers are often easier than a tight lie in the rough.

The difference is not talent. It is understanding what actually needs to happen in a bunker shot.

This guide covers everything you need to know about bunker play. Greenside splashes, fairway bunker strikes, and the practice drills that will turn fear into confidence.

## Why Bunkers Feel So Hard

Here is what makes bunker shots confusing: you are not supposed to hit the ball.

In every other golf shot, you try to make clean contact with the ball. In a greenside bunker, you hit the sand behind the ball and let the sand carry the ball out. This is completely counterintuitive.

Once you understand the physics, bunkers become much easier. The sand wedge is designed with a wide sole and bounce angle that skims through sand without digging. Your job is simply to enter the sand 1-2 inches behind the ball and exit through to a full finish.

The ball goes along for the ride.

## Greenside Bunker Basics

The greenside splash shot is your bread-and-butter bunker escape. Master this technique and you will get out of the sand successfully at least 90 percent of the time.

### Setup: Build Your Foundation

Your bunker setup is different from a normal shot:

**Stance**: Open your stance by pointing your feet 20-30 degrees left of target (for right-handed golfers). This creates room for the club to swing along your body line.

**Ball Position**: Play the ball forward in your stance, roughly in line with your front heel. This promotes hitting sand first.

**Clubface**: Open the clubface before you take your grip. Point it at the sky, not the target. An open face adds loft and exposes the bounce.

**Feet**: Dig your feet into the sand about an inch. This provides stability and lowers your swing arc to ensure sand contact.

**Weight**: Keep 60 percent of your weight on your front foot throughout the swing. This prevents the dreaded chunk or fat shot.

### The Swing: Commit and Accelerate

The bunker swing has one critical rule: accelerate through impact.

Most bunker failures come from deceleration. Golfers get scared of flying the green and slow down. The club digs into the sand and the ball goes nowhere.

Here is the correct sequence:

1. Take the club back along your stance line, not the target line
2. Hinge your wrists fully in the backswing
3. Swing down into the sand 1-2 inches behind the ball
4. Accelerate through the sand to a full finish
5. The clubhead should exit the sand past where the ball was

Think splash, not dig. You want a shallow cut through the top layer of sand, not a deep excavation.

### Distance Control

Controlling distance in bunkers comes from three factors:

**Length of Backswing**: A shorter backswing produces a shorter shot. A longer backswing sends the ball farther.

**How Much Sand You Take**: More sand means less distance. Taking a thinner slice of sand produces a longer shot.

**Clubface Angle**: A more open face produces a higher, shorter shot. A squarer face produces a lower, longer shot.

For most greenside shots within 15 yards, use a three-quarter backswing with a very open face. For longer bunker shots up to 30 yards, take a fuller swing with the face less open.

## Fairway Bunker Strategy

Fairway bunkers require a completely different approach. Here, you do want to hit the ball first.

### The Goal: Clean Contact

In a fairway bunker, you are trying to pick the ball cleanly off the sand. Any sand contact before the ball reduces distance and accuracy significantly.

### Setup Adjustments

**Club Selection**: Take one or two more clubs than the distance normally requires. A 7-iron shot becomes a 5-iron from a fairway bunker.

**Ball Position**: Move the ball slightly back in your stance, toward center. This promotes ball-first contact.

**Stance**: Dig your feet in minimally for stability, but not as much as a greenside bunker. Too much digging lowers your swing arc.

**Grip Down**: Choke down on the club about an inch to compensate for your feet being below ball level.

### The Swing

The fairway bunker swing prioritizes control over power:

1. Take a three-quarter backswing to maintain balance
2. Keep your lower body quieter than a normal swing
3. Focus on hitting the ball first with a slightly descending blow
4. Accept whatever distance you get rather than swinging harder

Swing within yourself. A clean contact from a fairway bunker with a 5-iron will outperform a chunked 7-iron every time.

### When to Just Get Out

If you have a poor lie, the bunker has a steep lip in front of you, or you are 200 yards from the green, forget the hero shot. Take your medicine and wedge it back to the fairway. One stroke lost is better than three.

## Common Bunker Mistakes

### 1. Not Opening the Clubface Enough

Most amateurs barely open the face. They set up like a normal shot and wonder why the ball comes out low and hot.

Really lay that face open for greenside bunkers. It should feel uncomfortable at first. The logo on the face should point almost at the sky.

### 2. Decelerating Through Impact

Fear causes deceleration. Golfers get tentative, slow their swing, and the club digs instead of sliding.

Make a commitment: whatever happens, you are swinging to a full finish. A ball that flies the green is better than one that stays in the bunker.

### 3. Trying to Help the Ball Up

Scooping or flipping through impact is deadly in bunkers. Trust the loft on your wedge and hit down and through the sand. The ball will go up on its own.

### 4. Inconsistent Entry Point

One shot you enter three inches behind the ball. The next, you catch it thin. This inconsistency comes from varying your setup or not having a consistent swing thought.

Pick a spot in the sand and hit that spot. Practice making your divot start exactly where you intend.

## Practice Drills

### The Line Drill

Draw a line in the practice bunker. Practice entering the sand exactly on that line, ignoring any ball. Once you can hit the line consistently, place a ball two inches in front of the line.

This builds the most important bunker skill: consistent entry point.

### The Dollar Bill Drill

Imagine a dollar bill in the sand with the ball on the president's face. Your goal is to take out the whole dollar bill. This helps visualize the correct amount of sand to take.

### The No-Ball Drill

Hit 20 bunker shots without a ball. Focus only on entering the sand with an open face and accelerating through to a full finish. Feel the club sliding through the sand rather than digging.

Once the motion feels natural, add a ball. You will be amazed at the difference.

### The Towel Drill

Lay a towel on the sand two inches behind where you place the ball. The goal is to enter the sand where the towel ends, not on the towel itself. This trains proper entry point without hitting too far behind.

## Equipment Considerations

Your sand wedge matters in bunkers. Here is what to look for:

**Bounce Angle**: More bounce (12-14 degrees) works better in soft, fluffy sand. Less bounce (8-10 degrees) is better for firm, packed sand.

**Sole Width**: A wider sole helps the club slide through sand more easily. Consider a sand wedge with a wider sole than your other wedges.

**Loft**: Standard sand wedges are 54-56 degrees. For very high, soft shots, a 58 or 60-degree lob wedge can be useful.

If you are unsure about your equipment, record your bunker practice with [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) and look at how the club is entering and exiting the sand.

## Mental Approach

Bunker anxiety is mostly about uncertainty. You are not confident because you have not practiced enough.

The solution is simple: spend time in the practice bunker. Most golfers ignore this area, but 15 minutes per practice session will transform your confidence.

When you step into a bunker during a round, take a breath. Visualize the sand splash and the ball landing softly on the green. Trust your technique and commit to the shot.

Bunkers are not hazards to fear. They are opportunities to demonstrate skill that most amateurs never develop.

## Quick Reference

**Greenside Bunker Checklist**:
- Open stance 20-30 degrees left
- Ball forward, off front heel
- Open clubface before gripping
- Dig feet in one inch
- Weight 60 percent forward
- Enter sand 1-2 inches behind ball
- Accelerate through to full finish

**Fairway Bunker Checklist**:
- Take 1-2 more clubs
- Ball slightly back of center
- Minimal foot dig
- Grip down one inch
- Three-quarter controlled swing
- Ball-first contact
- Accept the distance you get

Practice these fundamentals and bunkers will become one of the easier shots on the course. The key is understanding what needs to happen and committing to the technique without fear.
