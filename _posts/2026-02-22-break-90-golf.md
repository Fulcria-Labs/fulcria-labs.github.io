# How to Break 90 in Golf: The Realistic Guide

Breaking 90 is the moment golf changes. You've moved past the "just trying to make contact" phase. You can actually play—hit fairways, reach greens, and occasionally make a putt that matters.

But there's a gap between shooting 95-100 and consistently breaking 90. Let's close it.

## The Math of Breaking 90

Before diving into technique, understand what breaking 90 actually requires:

**89 = 17 bogeys and 1 double**

That's it. You don't need birdies. You don't even need pars. You need to avoid the big numbers.

Most golfers trying to break 90 don't lose strokes on the "simple" shots. They lose them on:
- The second shot OB after a bad drive
- Three-putts from 30 feet
- Chunks and skulls around the green
- Penalty strokes from water and hazards

Breaking 90 isn't about hitting great shots. It's about eliminating disasters.

## The Skills That Actually Matter

### 1. Tee Shots: Playable, Not Perfect

You don't need to hit the fairway every time. You need to stay in play.

**The Reality Check:**
- Fairways hit by golfers who shoot 90: about 5-7 per round
- Fairways hit by scratch golfers: about 8-10

That gap is smaller than you think. What matters more is avoiding OB, hazards, and unpayable lies.

**The Fix:**
Take less club. Seriously. If you're spraying driver, hit 3-wood or even a long iron. A ball in play 200 yards out beats a ball OB 280 yards every time.

Your ego doesn't count strokes. Your scorecard does.

### 2. Approach Shots: Hitting Greens (or Close)

The biggest skill gap between 90-shooters and 80-shooters is greens in regulation. But you don't need to hit 12 greens—you just need to get close.

**Target: Hit the "right half" of the green**

Most amateurs aim at the flag. Pros aim at the middle of the green. Why? Because:
- The flag is often near trouble
- Missing toward the center leaves easier up-and-downs
- You avoid short-sided chips

**The 7-Iron Rule:**
Most amateurs can't hit their 7-iron 155 yards in the air consistently. Know your real distances. Use a GPS or rangefinder and track your actual carry—not your best shot ever.

### 3. The Scoring Zone: Inside 100 Yards

This is where 90-shooters lose the most strokes without realizing it.

From 80 yards, the average golfer shoots about 4.0 strokes to hole out. That's a bogey from "wedge range."

**The Focus:**
- Get it on the green. That's the goal.
- Don't try to get it close—try to get it on
- Take enough club to carry any front bunkers

**Practice Priority:**
Spend 50% of your practice time inside 100 yards. Pitch shots, chips, and bunker play. This is where you'll actually lower your scores.

### 4. Putting: Eliminate Three-Putts

You don't need to make everything. You need to stop three-putting.

**The Simple Goal:**
From outside 20 feet, your goal is two putts. Period. Lag it close, tap it in.

**The Drill:**
Put a circle of tees 3 feet around the hole. From 30 feet, your job is to stop the ball inside that circle. Not in the hole—inside the circle. When you can do this 8/10 times, you've eliminated most three-putts.

### 5. Course Management: Playing Smart

This is the "free" strokes that most golfers ignore.

**Three Rules:**
1. **When in trouble, get out.** Don't try the hero shot. Punch back to the fairway.
2. **Miss in the right spot.** If there's water left, aim center-right.
3. **Know when to lay up.** If you can't carry the hazard 80% of the time, don't try.

Most players shooting 95-100 take on shots they should avoid. Every avoided penalty stroke is a stroke saved.

## The Practice Plan That Works

You have limited time to practice. Here's how to use it:

### Weekly Practice Split (2-3 hours total)

**Driving Range (45 minutes):**
- 10 balls with wedge (rhythm, contact)
- 15 balls with 7-iron (stock shot)
- 10 balls with hybrid or fairway wood
- 10 balls with driver (fairway focus, not distance)

**Short Game (45 minutes):**
- 15 minutes putting (lag drills from 25-35 feet)
- 15 minutes chipping (one club, multiple distances)
- 15 minutes pitching (50-80 yards to targets)

**Playing Practice (30 minutes):**
- Play 3-5 holes if possible
- Or: simulate on-course situations at the range

### The 80/20 of Practice

80% of your practice should be shots you'll hit during a round:
- Stock 7-iron
- 50-yard pitch
- 20-foot lag putt
- Chip from just off the green

20% can be specialty shots—but only after the fundamentals are solid.

## On-Course Strategy for Breaking 90

### Hole-by-Hole Mindset

**Par 4s (10 holes typically):**
- Goal: Bogey or better
- Tee shot: In play, even if short
- Approach: Get it on or near the green
- Up and down if you miss the green

**Par 5s (4 holes typically):**
- Goal: Bogey is fine, occasional par
- Play as three medium shots to the green
- Don't hero a 3-wood from 240

**Par 3s (4 holes typically):**
- Goal: Bogey or better
- Club up. Take enough to reach the middle.
- Avoid the front bunker at all costs

### Managing Bad Holes

They will happen. The question is whether a bogey becomes a double, or a double becomes a triple.

**The 6 Rule:**
If you're putting for 6 or higher, stop. Take a breath. Your only job now is to finish the hole—not salvage it. Get the ball on the green and two-putt.

## The Timeline to Breaking 90

Be honest about where you're starting:

**Currently shooting 100-105:**
- Focus: Eliminating penalties and three-putts
- Timeline: 3-6 months with consistent practice
- Key metric: Reduce lost balls per round to under 3

**Currently shooting 95-100:**
- Focus: Short game and course management
- Timeline: 1-3 months with targeted practice
- Key metric: Reduce three-putts to 3 or fewer per round

**Currently shooting 90-95:**
- Focus: Greens in regulation and putting
- Timeline: 1-2 months of focused work
- Key metric: Hit 5+ greens per round

## The Mindset Shift

Breaking 90 requires accepting a truth:

**Golf is about avoiding bad shots, not hitting great ones.**

The player who shoots 89 and the player who shoots 95 often hit the same number of "good" shots. The 89 just had fewer disasters.

Your best drive doesn't matter if your fourth shot is OB. Your perfect approach means nothing if you three-putt from 25 feet.

Be boring. Play smart. The scorecard doesn't know or care how pretty your swing looked.

## Your Action Plan

**This Week:**
1. Play a round tracking: penalties, three-putts, and greens missed by more than 30 feet
2. Identify your biggest leak (it's usually one of those three)
3. Build a practice plan around that weakness

**This Month:**
1. Practice short game at least twice per week
2. On the course: play smart, not heroic
3. Use a club you can hit straight off the tee

**Ongoing:**
Keep score honestly. Track your progress. Celebrate when you break 90—then start working on 85.

The goal isn't perfection. It's progress.
