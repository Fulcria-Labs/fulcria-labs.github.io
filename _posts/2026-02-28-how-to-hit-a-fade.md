# How to Hit a Fade: Master the Controlled Left-to-Right Shot

The fade is golf's most reliable shot shape. It curves gently from left to right (for right-handed golfers), lands softly, and is favored by many of the game's greatest players. Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, and Lee Trevino all built their games around the fade. Here's how to add it to yours.

## Why Play a Fade?

Before diving into mechanics, let's understand why the fade is so valuable:

**Control:** The fade typically curves less dramatically than a draw, making it more predictable. When you miss, you miss small.

**Soft Landing:** The left-to-right spin counteracts forward roll, helping your ball stop faster on firm greens.

**Accuracy:** A fade that overcooks slightly is usually still in play. An overdone draw becomes a hook - often a disaster.

**Consistency:** The fade swing is more repeatable for most golfers because it doesn't require aggressive face rotation.

## What Causes a Fade?

Understanding ball flight is essential. A fade requires:

1. **Club path traveling slightly left** (out-to-in)
2. **Clubface open to the path** but closed to the target

The ball starts where the face points and curves away from the path. So with an out-to-in path and a face that's open to that path, the ball starts slightly left and gently fades right.

## Step-by-Step: How to Hit a Fade

### 1. Weaken Your Grip Slightly

A weaker grip promotes an open face at impact:
- Rotate both hands slightly counterclockwise
- You should see only 1.5-2 knuckles on your left hand
- The V's point toward your chin or left shoulder

**Subtle change.** You're not making a dramatic shift - just enough to keep the face from closing aggressively.

### 2. Align Your Body Left of Target

Set up with your feet, hips, and shoulders aiming slightly left of where you want the ball to finish:
- Pick an intermediate target 5-15 yards left
- Align your body to that point
- Keep the clubface pointing at your actual target

This creates the open relationship between path and face that produces fade spin.

### 3. Ball Position: Slightly Forward

Move the ball about half an inch forward from normal. This:
- Encourages an out-to-in path
- Gives the face slightly less time to close
- Promotes the higher, softer flight characteristic of fades

### 4. Feel the Out-to-In Path

The swing sensation for a fade:
- Feel like you're pulling the grip toward your left hip through impact
- Swing slightly across the ball, toward left field
- Keep your chest rotating through - don't stall

**Key image:** Imagine you're cutting across the ball, not hitting through it.

### 5. Hold the Face Slightly Open

The final element is controlling the face:
- Feel like you're "holding off" the release slightly
- The toe shouldn't pass the heel as quickly as in a draw
- Your finish will feel slightly higher and more upright

## Common Fade Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Slicing Instead of Fading

A fade and a slice are not the same. The difference:
- **Fade:** Face is open to path, but still slightly closed to target. Ball starts on line, curves right.
- **Slice:** Face is wide open to target. Ball starts right and curves more right.

If you're hitting slices, your face is too open at impact. Check your grip and make sure you're still releasing - just not as aggressively.

### Mistake 2: Too Much Out-to-In

An extreme left path causes pulled shots and weak slices. The path should be slightly left - about 2-5 degrees - not dramatically across the ball.

### Mistake 3: Decelerating Through Impact

Some golfers try to "steer" the fade, slowing down through the ball. This causes inconsistent contact and distance loss. Commit to the shot and accelerate through.

## Practice Drills

### The Towel Drill

Place a towel under your right armpit. Hit shots while keeping the towel in place. This promotes the body connection that prevents the club from getting too far inside.

### Alignment Stick Gate

Set up two alignment sticks creating a gate just outside the ball. The path for a fade should exit slightly left of the target line.

### 50% Fade Drill

Start by hitting small 5-10 yard fades with short irons. Once consistent, gradually work up to full swings and longer clubs.

## When to Use a Fade

The fade is your go-to for:

- **Dogleg right holes** - Work the ball around the corner
- **Left-to-right wind** - Let the wind help your natural shape
- **Tucked pins** - The soft landing holds greens better
- **Tight fairways** - The predictable, controlled curve reduces big misses
- **Pressure situations** - The fade's reliability shines when you can't afford a big miss

## The Fade vs. Draw Debate

Should you play a fade or a draw? Here's the honest answer:

**For most amateurs:** The fade is easier to control. The swing is more natural for many players, and the miss pattern is typically safer.

**The distance myth:** Yes, draws can roll more, but modern equipment has minimized the distance gap. Many tour players prefer the fade's control over a few extra yards.

**The best shot:** The one you can repeat. If you naturally draw the ball, don't force a fade. But if you're building a new shot shape, the fade is often easier to master.

## Final Thoughts

The fade isn't just a backup shot - it can be your primary weapon. Players like Nicklaus and Hogan didn't fade the ball because they couldn't draw it. They chose the fade for its precision and reliability.

Start with small adjustments: slightly weaker grip, body aimed left, face at target, and a path that traces slightly left of your body line. The fade will become a shot you can trust when it matters most.
