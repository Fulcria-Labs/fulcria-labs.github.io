"Keep your left arm straight." It is one of the oldest pieces of golf advice. Your dad probably said it. Your playing partners definitely have. But what does it actually mean, and is rigid straightness really the goal?

The answer is more nuanced than most golfers realize. A straight left arm creates width and power, but forcing it into a locked position causes more problems than it solves.

Here is everything you need to know about the left arm in your golf swing, including drills to train it properly.

## Why the Left Arm Matters So Much

For right-handed golfers, the left arm (your lead arm) serves as the radius of your swing arc. Think of your left shoulder as the center of a circle and your left arm as the spoke. The longer and more consistent that spoke, the bigger and more predictable your swing arc becomes.

This matters for three reasons:

**Width equals power.** A wider swing arc means the clubhead travels further, giving it more time to accelerate before impact. This is free speed you cannot get any other way.

**Consistency in the strike zone.** When your left arm maintains its length throughout the swing, the club returns to the ball at a predictable height. Variable arm length means variable contact.

**Connection and control.** Your left arm is the primary link between your rotating body and the swinging club. When it stays extended, power transfers efficiently from your core to the clubhead.

This is why keeping the left arm straight in your golf swing is taught so universally. The principle is sound. The problem is how most golfers interpret it.

## The Debate: Rigid vs. Relaxed

Walk into any driving range and you will see two extremes. Some golfers keep their left arm so locked it looks painful. Others let it collapse completely at the top of the backswing.

Neither is correct.

### The Problem with Rigid

When you lock your left arm completely, several bad things happen:

**Tension spreads.** Locking your elbow tightens your forearm, which tightens your grip, which tightens your shoulders. Tension is the enemy of speed. You cannot swing fast with tight muscles.

**Rotation gets blocked.** A locked left arm often forces golfers to turn too far inside or lift their arms to create height in the backswing. This leads to over-the-top moves and slices.

**Timing suffers.** Rigid muscles do not respond well to the rapid direction change at the top of the swing. You need some suppleness to sequence the downswing properly.

If your left arm feels uncomfortable at the top of your backswing, you are probably overdoing it.

### The Problem with Too Much Bend

On the other end, a collapsed left arm creates its own set of issues:

**Lost width means lost power.** Every inch your arm bends shortens your swing arc. That translates directly to lost clubhead speed.

**Inconsistent contact.** A bent arm at the top must somehow straighten before impact. This requires perfect timing that most amateur golfers cannot repeat under pressure.

**Over-the-top tendency.** A collapsed left arm often forces the hands to take over in the downswing, pulling the club across the target line.

The chicken wing finish you see in high-handicap golfers often starts with a collapsed left arm at the top.

### What the Pros Actually Do

Here is what the data shows: most professional golfers start with a straight left arm at address, allow about five degrees of bend at the top of the backswing, and have approximately eight degrees of bend at impact.

That is not ramrod straight. But it is not bent either. It is extended with just enough flex to stay relaxed and responsive.

The key phrase is "straight but not rigid." Your left arm should be extended fully without the elbow being locked. Think of stretching your arm out rather than tensing it straight.

## How to Find the Right Left Arm Position

### Step 1: Check Your Setup

Your left arm position at address sets up everything that follows. Stand with both arms fully extended but relaxed, hanging naturally from your shoulders. A small amount of bend is acceptable, but you should not see a visible angle in your elbow.

Make sure your [grip pressure is light enough](/2026/01/31/golf-grip-pressure-guide/) to allow your arms to hang naturally. Death-gripping the club forces your arms into tension before the swing even starts.

### Step 2: Focus on Width, Not Straightness

Here is the mindset shift that helps most golfers: instead of thinking "keep my left arm straight," think "keep my swing wide."

To create width, push the club away from your body with your hands during the takeaway. Let your left arm extend as a result of this push rather than consciously forcing it straight.

When you focus on width, your left arm straightens naturally without the tension that comes from forcing it. The result is the same extended position with none of the negative side effects.

### Step 3: Let Your Body Turn Do the Work

Many left arm problems come from inadequate body rotation. If your shoulders stop turning but your arms keep swinging, something has to give. Usually it is your left arm, which bends to allow the club to travel further than your rotation supports.

Work on your [shoulder turn](/2026/01/31/golf-shoulder-turn/) to support a full arm extension. When your upper body rotates fully, your left arm can stay extended without strain because your rotation is carrying the club, not your arms alone.

## Four Drills to Improve Left Arm Control

### Drill 1: Split Grip Extension Feel

This drill teaches you what true width feels like.

1. Grip the club with your hands split about six inches apart
2. Take your backswing focusing on maintaining the gap between your hands
3. Feel the stretch in your chest and lead arm as you reach the top
4. Hit half-speed shots maintaining this stretched feeling

The split grip makes it impossible to bend your left arm without the gap closing. It ingrains the feeling of extension through body rotation rather than arm manipulation.

### Drill 2: Left Arm Only Swings

Swinging with only your left arm forces you to use your body correctly.

1. Remove your right hand from the club entirely
2. Make small swings using only your left arm and hand
3. Focus on rotating your shoulders and hips to move the club
4. Build up to half swings, hitting balls off a tee

You will immediately notice that you cannot generate any power without body rotation. This drill reinforces the connection between your turning core and extended left arm.

### Drill 3: Alignment Stick Body Check

This drill prevents the common over-the-top move that often accompanies left arm issues.

1. Hold an alignment stick or PVC pipe extending from your left hip along your left side
2. Make your backswing ensuring your chest keeps turning through the motion
3. In the downswing, continue rotating so the stick never hits your body
4. If the stick contacts you, your chest stopped and your hands took over

This works because it forces your body to keep rotating through impact. When rotation stalls, the left arm tends to bend and the hands flip, causing the stick to hit your side.

### Drill 4: Stop-and-Check Drill

This drill builds awareness of your left arm position at key checkpoints.

1. Make your backswing and stop at the top
2. Without moving, check your left arm position in a mirror or video
3. Note any excessive bend or rigid tension
4. Resume the swing and complete it to a full finish
5. Stop again and check your left arm at the finish position

Developing awareness of your positions trains your body to find the correct extension naturally. Record yourself and compare your positions to [professional swing sequences](/2026/01/22/golf-backswing/) to identify differences.

## Strengthening Exercises for Left Arm Control

If you struggle to maintain left arm extension, weakness might be part of the problem. These exercises build the strength and endurance needed for consistent arm position.

**Rear Deltoid Rows:** This exercise strengthens the rhomboids and rear deltoids that support a fully extended left arm. Perform 2-3 sets of 15-20 reps with light weight, focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top.

**Farmer's Carries:** Hold a heavy dumbbell in your left hand and walk for 30-40 yards. This develops the grip and forearm endurance that prevents your left wrist from breaking down during the swing. The isometric hold trains the muscles used to maintain arm extension under load.

**Stretching:** Tight shoulders and chest muscles can prevent full arm extension. Add doorway pec stretches and cross-body shoulder stretches to your routine. Improved flexibility allows you to achieve proper extension without fighting your own body.

## Common Left Arm Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake: Locking the Elbow at Address

**The problem:** Starting with a locked elbow creates tension before you move.

**The fix:** Let your arms hang naturally with soft elbows. Your left arm should be straight but not hyperextended. Think "long" rather than "locked."

### Mistake: Pulling Arms to Body in Backswing

**The problem:** Drawing your arms close to your chest shortens the swing arc and forces the left arm to bend.

**The fix:** Push the club away from you during the takeaway. Feel like you are reaching toward the target line rather than wrapping around your body.

### Mistake: Losing Extension at the Top

**The problem:** The left arm bends excessively when the backswing reaches its full extent.

**The fix:** This usually indicates limited shoulder turn. Work on your [posture](/2026/01/31/golf-posture-fundamentals/) and flexibility to allow a fuller rotation that supports extended arms.

### Mistake: Chicken Wing at Impact

**The problem:** The left elbow bends outward through impact, losing power and causing thin or heeled shots.

**The fix:** Focus on rotating your chest through impact rather than swinging with your hands. The chicken wing happens when the body stalls and the arms take over.

## Using Video to Check Your Left Arm

One of the fastest ways to improve your left arm position is to see it. Recording your swing from face-on and down-the-line angles reveals exactly what your left arm is doing at each phase.

Look for these checkpoints:

- **Address:** Left arm extended, elbow soft, slight angle between lead arm and club shaft
- **Halfway back:** Left arm straight, club parallel to ground, hands away from body
- **Top of backswing:** Left arm mostly straight with minimal bend (5 degrees maximum)
- **Impact:** Left arm extended, slight bend acceptable (8 degrees or less)
- **Follow-through:** Both arms extended toward target, then folding naturally

Compare your positions to these benchmarks. If you see significant deviations, you know exactly what to work on.

The Swing Analyzer app can help identify left arm issues automatically, giving you instant feedback on extension and position at each swing phase. Getting objective data removes the guesswork from improvement.

## Key Takeaways

The left arm in your golf swing should be straight but not rigid. Extension creates width, power, and consistency. Tension creates problems.

Focus on these principles:

1. Push the club away to create width rather than forcing your arm straight
2. Use full body rotation to support extended arms
3. Maintain soft elbows that are extended without being locked
4. Practice drills that build the feeling of proper extension
5. Use video to check your positions objectively

A properly extended left arm is one of the fundamentals that separates good ball strikers from the rest. Work on it consistently, and you will see improvement in both power and accuracy.

Your left arm is the radius of your swing. Keep it long, keep it relaxed, and let your body rotation do the heavy lifting.
