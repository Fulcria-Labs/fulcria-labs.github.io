# How to Build a Pre-Shot Routine That Actually Works

Watch any tour player and you'll notice something: they do the exact same thing before every shot. Same look at the target, same practice swings, same waggle, same trigger. This isn't superstition. It's strategic.

A good pre-shot routine is your insurance policy against pressure. When the match is on the line or you're standing over water, your brain wants to panic. Your routine keeps it busy with familiar actions instead.

But here's the problem: most amateur routines are either too long, too vague, or completely forgotten when it matters. Let's fix that.

## Why Pre-Shot Routines Work

Your brain can only focus on so many things at once. When you're thinking about the tournament leader board, the people watching, or that water hazard, there's no bandwidth left for actually hitting the shot.

A routine solves this by giving your brain a job. Instead of worrying, you're following a checklist. And when that checklist becomes automatic, the swing that follows tends to be automatic too.

### The Science Behind It

Research on motor learning shows that consistent preparation leads to consistent execution. Your body associates the routine with "time to perform" and responds with the patterns you've grooved in practice.

This is why you hit the ball better on the range—you're relaxed and following your natural rhythm. A pre-shot routine recreates that state on the course.

## The Three Phases of an Effective Routine

Every good routine has three distinct phases: assessment, commitment, and execution.

### Phase 1: Assessment (Behind the Ball)

This is where you gather information and make decisions. Do this work BEFORE you step up to the ball.

**What to assess:**
- Lie condition (uphill, downhill, sidehill, rough depth)
- Distance to target and any hazards
- Wind direction and strength
- Where you want the ball to land and roll out
- What shot shape you're playing

**The key:** Make your decision and commit. Second-guessing belongs to this phase only. Once you're done assessing, the decision is made.

### Phase 2: Commitment (Moving to the Ball)

This is the transition from thinking to feeling. You're moving from analytical mode to athletic mode.

**What happens here:**
- Take one or two practice swings that rehearse the feel you want
- Visualize the shot (ball flight, landing, roll)
- Take a deep breath to settle your body
- Feel calm and focused, not mechanical

**The key:** Your practice swing should match your intended shot. If you're hitting a punch shot, practice a punch swing. If you're hitting a full driver, make a full practice swing. Don't just go through the motions.

### Phase 3: Execution (Over the Ball)

This is the shortest phase. Once you're over the ball, thinking should be minimal.

**What happens here:**
- Align clubface to intermediate target
- Set your feet and stance
- Final look at target
- Pull the trigger

**The key:** This phase should take 10-15 seconds maximum. Longer than that and tension builds. Your waggle or forward press is the "go" signal—once it happens, swing.

## Building Your Personal Routine

Your routine should feel natural to you. Don't copy Bryson's slow-motion analysis if you're a feel player. Don't rush like Rickie if you need more time to settle.

### Elements to Consider Including

**Target selection ritual.** Stand behind the ball, pick an intermediate target 2-3 feet in front of the ball on your target line. This is easier to align to than a flag 150 yards away.

**Practice swing with purpose.** Feel the shot you want to hit. This isn't a warm-up; it's a dress rehearsal.

**Breath work.** One deep exhale before addressing the ball releases tension and signals "game time" to your nervous system.

**Waggle or forward press.** A small movement that prevents static tension and acts as your go-trigger.

### What NOT to Include

**Swing thoughts.** Your routine prepares you for the swing, but thinking "keep my elbow tucked" over the ball is a recipe for disaster. If you need a swing thought, keep it to one simple feel, not a mechanical checklist.

**Outcome focus.** "Don't hit it in the water" is not helpful. Focus on the process—the shot you're executing—not the consequences.

**Extra looks.** More than two looks at the target creates indecision. See the target, address the ball, one final look, go.

## Sample Pre-Shot Routines

### The 30-Second Routine (For Feel Players)

1. Stand behind ball, pick intermediate target (3 seconds)
2. Visualize ball flight to target (3 seconds)
3. Walk to ball, set clubface to intermediate target (5 seconds)
4. One practice swing with intended feel (5 seconds)
5. Deep breath, set feet (5 seconds)
6. Look at target, waggle, swing (5 seconds)

### The 45-Second Routine (For Analytical Players)

1. Stand behind ball, assess lie and conditions (5 seconds)
2. Pick club, pick intermediate target (5 seconds)
3. Visualize shot shape and landing zone (5 seconds)
4. Walk to ball, set clubface (5 seconds)
5. Two practice swings rehearsing the feel (10 seconds)
6. Deep breath, set feet (5 seconds)
7. Look at target, waggle, forward press, swing (10 seconds)

## Making It Automatic

A routine only works if you do it every time. On the range. On the course. On easy shots and hard shots.

### Practice Your Routine, Not Just Your Swing

During range sessions, go through your full pre-shot routine on at least half your shots. Many amateurs machine-gun balls on the range, then wonder why they can't focus on the course. You never practiced focusing.

### Time Yourself

Know how long your routine takes. This helps with pace of play and helps you recognize when you're rushing (nerves) or dragging (indecision).

### Commit to the Reset

Here's the real test: when something interrupts your routine—a cart noise, a playing partner moving, a gust of wind—STEP AWAY and restart. Don't try to salvage a broken routine. Hitting a bad shot because you were distracted is entirely avoidable.

## Pre-Shot Routine for Putting

Putting routines should be simpler and faster, but the principles are the same.

1. Read the green from behind the ball and behind the hole
2. Pick your line and commit to it
3. Take one or two practice strokes feeling the distance
4. Set putter behind ball, feet in position
5. One look at the hole, one look at the ball, stroke

**The key with putting:** excessive looks at the hole create doubt. Trust your read. You're better at reading greens than you think—it's the second-guessing that kills you.

## Troubleshooting Your Routine

**Problem: Taking too long, annoying playing partners.**
Solution: Cut elements. You probably don't need three practice swings and four looks at the target. Streamline to essentials.

**Problem: Routine doesn't work under pressure.**
Solution: Practice it under pressure. On the range, imagine it's the first tee with people watching. Make the practice conditions match the course conditions.

**Problem: Mind wanders during routine.**
Solution: Add a physical checkpoint. Some players squeeze the grip before they swing as a focus cue. Others have a specific trigger word. Find what grounds you.

**Problem: Good on course, falls apart in competition.**
Solution: Your routine isn't automatic yet. You need more repetitions where it's truly on autopilot. Consider tournament practice rounds where you play every shot like it counts.

## Use Video to Lock It In

Recording yourself isn't just for swing analysis. Film a few shots with your pre-shot routine included. Look for:

- Consistent timing from phase to phase
- Body language that shows commitment
- A clear trigger that starts your swing
- No hesitation or extra movements

A good swing analyzer app can help you compare routines side by side, ensuring you're consistent from session to session.

## The Bottom Line

A pre-shot routine isn't a magic spell—it's a habit. Build one that fits your personality, practice it until it's automatic, and trust it when the pressure's on.

The pros don't have better nerve control than you. They just have better preparation. Your routine is how you manufacture that same calm focus, one shot at a time.

Start simple. Practice consistently. And when the routine kicks in, get out of your own way and let the swing happen.
