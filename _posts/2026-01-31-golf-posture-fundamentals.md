Your golf posture is the foundation of everything that follows. Get it right and your body can move freely through the swing. Get it wrong and you are fighting compensations before the club even moves.

Most golfers never think about posture after their first lesson. That is a mistake. Poor posture is silently limiting your power, consistency, and even your back health. The good news is that proper posture is simple to learn and easy to check.

Here is everything you need to know about building posture that sets up a better swing.

## Why Posture Matters More Than You Think

Posture determines three critical things in your golf swing:

**Rotation capability.** A hunched back restricts how much you can turn. A proper spine angle allows your shoulders to rotate fully while maintaining balance.

**Arm swing path.** Your posture dictates where your arms can naturally hang and swing. Stand too upright and you will swing too flat. Hunch over too much and you will swing too steep.

**Consistency.** When your posture varies shot to shot, your swing plane varies too. You cannot groove a repeatable swing on an inconsistent foundation.

Tour players obsess over posture because they know small changes at address create big changes at impact. Amateur golfers should do the same.

## The Five Elements of Perfect Golf Posture

Great posture comes down to five key checkpoints. Master these and you have built a foundation that supports a powerful, repeatable swing.

### 1. Spine Angle: The Tilt From Your Hips

Your spine angle is the forward tilt of your torso at address. This is the most important posture element and the one most golfers get wrong.

**The correct feel:** Bend forward from your hip joints, not your waist. Your back should remain relatively straight, not rounded. Imagine a rod running along your spine from tailbone to the back of your head. That rod should form a straight line angled forward.

**How to find it:**

1. Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart
2. Hold a club across your hips with both hands
3. Push your hips back as if you are closing a car door with your rear end
4. Let your torso tilt forward as your hips push back
5. Stop when your arms can hang naturally below your shoulders

This hip hinge, not a waist bend, creates the athletic position that allows rotation. When you bend from the waist instead, your lower back rounds and your shoulder turn becomes restricted.

The ideal spine angle varies slightly by body type and club, but most golfers settle around 35-45 degrees of forward tilt with a driver and slightly more with shorter clubs.

### 2. Hip Hinge: The Engine of Your Rotation

The hip hinge works together with spine angle. When you push your hips back correctly, you create the space your arms need to swing freely and the athletic base your body needs to rotate powerfully.

**Common mistake:** Many golfers squat down instead of hinging. They bend their knees excessively while keeping their hips under them. This puts weight on the toes, restricts hip turn, and leads to the dreaded reverse pivot.

**The fix:** Your weight should feel centered or slightly toward your heels at address. Your rear end should stick out behind you. Think of the ready position in other sports, like a shortstop or tennis player about to receive serve.

For more on how your hips work throughout the swing, see our [hip rotation guide](/blog/golf-hip-rotation/).

### 3. Knee Flex: Athletic, Not Deep

Your knees need some flex at address, but less than most golfers think. The goal is an athletic position, not a deep squat.

**The right amount:** Slightly flexed, just enough that you feel springy and athletic. If someone pushed you lightly, you would be stable but ready to move.

**Signs of too much knee flex:**

- Weight moves to your toes
- Thighs burn before you even swing
- You feel stuck or cramped
- Difficulty rotating hips fully

**Signs of too little knee flex:**

- Legs feel locked or stiff
- No athletic tension in your legs
- Tendency to sway rather than rotate

When your knee flex is correct, you should feel like you could hold this position comfortably for a full minute. If your legs are shaking after 10 seconds, you are squatting too deep.

### 4. Arm Hang: Let Gravity Do the Work

Once you have established your spine angle and hip hinge, your arms should hang naturally from your shoulders. This is not a position you force. It is a position you allow.

**The test:** Set up without a club. Let your arms hang completely relaxed. Now bring your palms together. Where do they meet? That is approximately where your hands should grip the club.

For most golfers, this means the hands hang roughly under the chin or just outside it. Not reaching out toward the ball. Not pulled in tight to the body. Just hanging.

**Why this matters:** Tension in the arms at address transfers through the swing. Relaxed arms can accelerate freely. Tense arms fight themselves all the way to impact.

When you grip the club, your arms should feel the same as when they hung freely. If you feel any reaching or pulling, adjust your distance from the ball rather than your arm position.

Our [grip guide](/blog/golf-grip-guide/) covers how to complete your connection to the club without introducing tension.

### 5. Chin Position: Room to Turn

This is the most overlooked posture element. Your chin position directly affects how much you can rotate.

**The problem:** Many golfers tuck their chin into their chest at address, often in an attempt to keep their eye on the ball. This blocks the shoulder from turning under the chin on the backswing.

**The fix:** Your chin should be up enough that someone could see your neck from the front. Think proud chest, chin away from your sternum. You should be able to rotate your left shoulder under your chin on the backswing without feeling blocked.

A good checkpoint: at address, you should be able to see the ball with a slight downward gaze of your eyes, not by bending your neck down toward your chest.

## Common Posture Mistakes and Their Effects

Poor posture creates predictable swing problems. Here is what happens when each element breaks down.

### The Hunch (Rounded Spine)

**What it looks like:** Upper back rounded, shoulders forward, head dropped toward the ball.

**What it causes:**

- Restricted shoulder turn
- Arms swing too steep (over the top path)
- Loss of power from limited coil
- Increased risk of back strain

**How to fix it:** Focus on the hip hinge, not the bend. Push your rear end back and feel your spine straighten as you tilt forward. A proud chest helps here too.

### The Reverse C (Excessive Arch)

**What it looks like:** Lower back excessively arched, belly pushed toward the ball.

**What it causes:**

- Reverse pivot (weight moves to front foot on backswing)
- Difficulty maintaining posture through the swing
- Lower back pain over time

**How to fix it:** Engage your core slightly at address. You should feel your abdominal muscles lightly active, not crunched tight but not completely relaxed either.

### Standing Too Close

**What it looks like:** Arms cramped, elbows bent at address, hands very close to thighs.

**What it causes:**

- Steep swing plane
- Arms cannot extend through impact
- Toe hits common
- Pulls and slices

**How to fix it:** Back away until your arms hang naturally. There should be roughly a hand-width between the butt of the club and your front thigh.

### Standing Too Far

**What it looks like:** Arms reaching for the ball, weight on toes, significant lean forward.

**What it causes:**

- Flat swing plane
- Loss of balance during swing
- Heel hits common
- Pushes and hooks

**How to fix it:** Move closer until your arms hang vertically from your shoulders. Weight should feel centered or slightly toward heels.

### The Squat

**What it looks like:** Deep knee bend, hips under the body instead of behind it, weight on toes.

**What it causes:**

- Restricted hip rotation
- Tendency to stand up during the swing
- Inconsistent contact
- Early extension through impact

**How to fix it:** Less knee flex, more hip hinge. Push your hips back rather than down.

## Three Drills to Build Better Posture

Reading about posture is one thing. Training it into your body is another. These three drills will help you feel and repeat proper posture.

### Drill 1: The Wall Hip Hinge

This drill teaches the hip hinge movement pattern without a club.

1. Stand about 6 inches from a wall with your back to it
2. Cross your arms over your chest
3. Push your hips back until your rear end touches the wall
4. Feel your torso tilt forward as your hips move back
5. Your back should stay straight, not rounded

Repeat 10-15 times before practice sessions. This movement pattern should feel automatic at address.

### Drill 2: Club on Spine Check

This drill verifies your spine angle is straight, not curved.

1. Take your address position
2. Have a friend hold a club along your spine
3. The club should touch your tailbone, mid-back, and back of your head
4. If it only touches two of three points, you have either too much curve (rounded) or too much arch

If you practice alone, use video from the down-the-line angle. A straight line from your tailbone to the back of your head indicates good spine angle.

### Drill 3: The Arm Drop Test

This drill ensures your arms are hanging naturally, not reaching or cramped.

1. Take your address position with a club
2. Let go of the club (have a friend catch it or let it fall on the grass)
3. Let your arms hang completely dead
4. Bring your hands back together naturally
5. Are they in the same position where they held the club?

If your relaxed hands meet where the club was, your arm position was correct. If they meet significantly closer to or farther from your body, adjust your distance from the ball accordingly.

## Posture Checkpoints for Your Pre-Shot Routine

You cannot check every posture element on every shot. That would take forever and kill your rhythm. Instead, build one or two quick checkpoints into your [pre-shot routine](/blog/golf-pre-shot-routine/).

**Quick posture checklist:**

1. Hip hinge complete (rear end pushed back, weight centered)
2. Arms hanging naturally
3. Chin up enough for shoulder clearance

That takes about two seconds. Make it automatic.

Some golfers add a waggle or small hip shift to confirm they feel athletic and ready. Others take a breath and let their shoulders relax. Find what works for you and repeat it every time.

## Maintaining Posture Through the Swing

Setting good posture at address is only half the battle. You also need to maintain it through impact.

**Early extension** is the most common posture breakdown. This is when your hips thrust toward the ball during the downswing, causing you to stand up and lose your spine angle. It is extremely common among amateur golfers and causes both thin and fat shots depending on timing.

Signs of early extension:

- Your belt buckle moves toward the ball during the downswing
- You finish standing straight up instead of tilted forward
- You feel your arms getting cramped at impact
- Thin shots and blocks are common

The fix for early extension starts at address but involves the entire swing sequence. Proper hip rotation (turning, not thrusting) helps maintain your posture through impact. For drills specific to early extension, see our [hip rotation guide](/blog/golf-hip-rotation/).

## How Video Analysis Reveals Posture Problems

Posture issues are hard to feel but easy to see. What feels like a straight back might actually be a significant hunch. What feels like a slight knee flex might be a deep squat.

This is where video analysis becomes invaluable. Recording your swing from the down-the-line angle reveals your spine angle, knee flex, and hip hinge clearly. Face-on video shows your chin position and arm hang.

Compare your address position to tour players with similar body types. The differences often surprise golfers who thought their posture was solid.

AI-powered analysis can measure your posture angles precisely and track whether you maintain those angles through impact. This gives you objective feedback on what would otherwise be guesswork.

## The Connection to Your Backswing

Good posture at address sets up everything that follows. When your spine angle and hip hinge are correct, your backswing turn happens naturally. When they are off, you compensate from the start.

Golfers with rounded spines cannot complete a full shoulder turn. Their body physically will not allow it. So they lift their arms instead of turning, creating an arm swing disconnected from their body rotation.

Golfers with excessive knee flex cannot rotate their hips fully. Their lower body is locked, so power comes only from the upper body.

These limitations become obvious during the [backswing](/blog/golf-backswing/), but they are created at address. Fix posture and you often fix backswing problems automatically.

## Your Posture Action Plan

Here is how to improve your golf posture this week:

**Today:**

1. Practice the wall hip hinge drill 15 times
2. Record your current address position from down-the-line
3. Check your spine angle with the club-on-spine test

**This week:**

1. Include a posture checkpoint in every pre-shot routine
2. Focus on one element per practice session
3. Record your setup at the end of the week and compare

**Ongoing:**

1. Re-check your posture monthly (it drifts over time)
2. Stretch your hip flexors and hamstrings to maintain mobility
3. Strengthen your core to hold posture through the swing

Posture is not glamorous. You will not find viral videos about spine angle or hip hinge. But the golfers who master these fundamentals have an advantage over those who skip straight to swing tips. Build the foundation correctly and everything built on top of it becomes easier.
