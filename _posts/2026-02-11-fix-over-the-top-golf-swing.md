If you've ever watched your ball start left and then curve even further into trouble, you've likely experienced the frustration of an over the top golf swing. This is one of the most common swing faults among amateur golfers, and it's the primary culprit behind the dreaded slice.

The good news? Coming over the top is completely fixable. Once you understand what's happening in your swing and apply the right drills, you can transform your ball flight from a weak fade or slice into a powerful draw.

## What Does "Coming Over the Top" Actually Mean?

When golfers talk about an over the top golf swing, they're describing a specific movement that happens during the transition from backswing to downswing. Instead of the club dropping down and approaching the ball from inside the target line, the club moves outward—away from your body—and approaches the ball on a steep, outside-to-in path.

Picture your swing plane as an inclined disc around your body. In an ideal swing, the club stays on or slightly under this plane during the downswing. When you come over the top, your first move down is to throw your right shoulder and hands outward toward the ball, forcing the club above the plane and onto that steep, slicing path.

You can often spot this fault in slow-motion video. Watch your clubhead at the top of the backswing, then track it as you start down. If it moves outward toward the ball before dropping down, that's the over the top move.

## Why Coming Over the Top Causes Slices and Pulls

Understanding the ball flight laws helps explain why this swing fault is so destructive. Your ball starts where the clubface is pointing at impact and curves based on the difference between face angle and swing path.

With an over the top swing, you're delivering the club on an outside-to-in path—meaning the club is moving left of your target (for right-handed golfers) through impact. What happens next depends on your clubface:

**The Slice**: If your clubface is open relative to your swing path, the ball starts left of target and then curves hard to the right. This is the classic slice that plagues so many amateur golfers. The more open the face relative to the path, the more severe the curve.

**The Pull**: If your clubface is square to your swing path (but still left of target), the ball starts left and stays left. It flies relatively straight, just in the wrong direction.

**The Pull-Slice**: The worst of both worlds—the ball starts left and then curves right, often ending up even further right than where you aimed.

Here's why the over the top move makes it so hard to square the face: when the club is approaching on a steep, outside path, your arms can't rotate naturally through impact. If you let your forearms release, you'd miss the ball entirely to the outside. So your brain compensates by pulling your arms in and dragging the grip left, which keeps the face open and produces that weak, slicing ball flight.

## The Hidden Causes of Your Over the Top Move

Before diving into the fixes, it helps to understand why you might be coming over the top in the first place. Often, it's not just a swing mechanics issue—it starts before you even take the club back.

**Poor Alignment**: Many golfers who fight an over the top swing are actually aiming their body far to the right of the target. When your feet, hips, and shoulders point right, your brain senses that the ball will go right, so it forces an over the top move to pull the shot back online. Ironically, this compensation creates the exact slice you were trying to avoid.

**Grip Issues**: A weak grip (hands rotated too far left on the club) makes it difficult to close the face through impact. Your brain knows the face will be open, so it steepens the swing to compensate.

**Ball Position**: Playing the ball too far forward encourages an outside-in path because you're reaching for the ball at impact.

**Tension and Rushing**: Gripping too tight or rushing the transition creates tension in your shoulders, which triggers the over the top move. Your big muscles take over when they should be quiet.

## 5 Proven Drills to Fix Your Over the Top Golf Swing

Now for the practical part. These drills address the root causes of the over the top move and help you feel what a proper inside path should be. Practice them regularly, and you'll start to see real changes in your ball flight.

### Drill 1: The Headcover Drill

This classic drill gives you instant feedback on your swing path and is one of the most effective ways to stop coming over the top.

**Setup**: Place a headcover (or small towel) on the ground about six to eight inches behind the ball, just outside your target line. You want it positioned so that an over the top swing would hit it on the way down.

**Execution**: Make slow, controlled swings focusing on swinging under the headcover. Feel your arms move more around your body rather than lifting steeply. On the downswing, keep your chest closed while your arms and club swing down and under the obstacle.

**Progression**: Start with 10-15 slow-motion reps without a ball. Then try hitting 30-yard shots, gradually increasing distance as you groove the feeling. If you hit the headcover, you know you're still coming over the top.

**Why it works**: The headcover creates a physical barrier that prevents the over the top move. Your brain quickly learns to route the club on a more inside path to avoid the obstacle.

### Drill 2: Trail Foot Flare

Sometimes the simplest fixes are the most effective. This setup adjustment naturally promotes an inside swing path.

**Setup**: At address, flare your trail foot (right foot for right-handed golfers) outward about 20-30 degrees. Your toe should point away from the target line rather than straight ahead or slightly in.

**Execution**: Make your normal swing with this adjusted stance. The flared foot allows your hips to rotate more freely in the backswing and creates more room for your arms to drop inside on the downswing.

**Why it works**: The flared trail foot improves hip rotation and naturally puts the club on a more inside path. It removes a physical restriction that might be forcing you over the top.

### Drill 3: The Step Drill for Weight Shift

Many over the top swings stem from poor weight transfer. This drill exaggerates the proper sequence and helps you feel the correct lower body action.

**Setup**: Take your normal stance but lift your lead heel off the ground so you're balanced on your trail foot. Hold a club in your normal grip.

**Execution**: Start your backswing and let your weight load into your trail leg. As you transition to the downswing, step your lead foot down and toward the target before your arms swing down. Feel like your lower body leads while your arms drop passively.

**Why it works**: When your lower body initiates the downswing correctly, your arms naturally drop into the slot rather than throwing outward. The step makes it physically impossible to start down with your shoulders.

### Drill 4: The Motorcycle Drill for Wrist Position

Your lead wrist position at the top of the swing directly affects your swing path. This drill helps you feel the correct position.

**Setup**: Take your normal grip and make a backswing. At the top, pause and focus on your lead wrist.

**Execution**: From the top of your backswing, imagine you're revving a motorcycle throttle with your lead hand. This motion flexes your lead wrist (bows it toward the target) and closes the clubface. Feel this flexion as you start the downswing.

**Why it works**: When your lead wrist moves into flexion, it closes the clubface and puts the club in position to approach from the inside. An over the top swing typically features an extended (cupped) lead wrist that opens the face and steepens the path.

### Drill 5: The Loop Drill

This drill deliberately exaggerates the opposite move to retrain your swing path. It feels strange at first but is remarkably effective.

**Setup**: Take your normal address position with any mid-iron.

**Execution**: Make a backswing, but as you start down, deliberately loop the club to the inside—feel like you're dropping the clubhead behind you before swinging out to the ball. Exaggerate the sensation of swinging from inside-to-out, as if you're trying to hit the ball to right field.

**Progression**: Start with half swings at half speed. The loop will feel excessive at first, but that's the point. Gradually reduce the exaggeration as the inside path becomes more natural.

**Why it works**: If your normal pattern is over the top, the opposite pattern is to loop under. By practicing the extreme opposite move, you recalibrate your sense of what "normal" should feel like. What feels like an inside-out swing is probably actually straight.

## Putting It All Together

Fixing an over the top golf swing takes time and consistent practice. Here's a suggested approach:

**Week 1-2**: Focus on the Headcover Drill and Trail Foot Flare. These address the immediate swing path issue without requiring major changes to your feel.

**Week 3-4**: Add the Step Drill to improve your sequencing. Many golfers find this is the key that unlocks everything else.

**Week 5+**: Incorporate the Motorcycle and Loop drills for more advanced path and face control.

Throughout this process, use video analysis to track your progress. AI-powered swing analysis can give you objective feedback on whether your club is truly approaching from the inside or if old habits are creeping back.

## Common Mistakes When Fixing Over the Top

As you work on these drills, watch out for these pitfalls:

**Swinging too far inside**: Some golfers overcorrect and start swinging too much from inside-out, resulting in push shots and hooks. The goal is a neutral path, not an extreme inside attack.

**Ignoring the grip and alignment**: All the drills in the world won't help if your fundamentals are fighting you. Check your grip and alignment regularly.

**Practicing too fast**: Speed hides flaws. Do most of your drill work at 50-75% speed until the new pattern is ingrained.

**Expecting instant results**: Your over the top move probably developed over years. Give yourself weeks or months to build new habits.

## Your Path to Straighter Shots

Coming over the top might be the most common swing fault in golf, but it's far from permanent. With the right understanding and dedicated practice, you can develop an inside swing path that produces powerful, consistent ball flight.

Start with one or two drills that resonate with you. Practice them regularly—even 10 minutes a day of focused work beats an hour of mindless range balls. Use video to check your progress, and be patient with yourself.

The first time you watch your ball start slightly right of target and draw back to center, you'll know the work was worth it. That feeling of compressing the ball with an inside path is one of the most satisfying sensations in golf—and it's within your reach.
