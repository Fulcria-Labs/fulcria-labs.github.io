Three-putts kill scores. Not because you can't read greens or stroke the ball well, but because you can't control distance. A 40-footer that ends up 8 feet past is harder than the original putt. A 30-footer left 6 feet short means pressure on your second putt.

Lag putting is the solution. It's the art of getting long putts close enough that the second putt is a formality. Master it, and you'll watch your scores drop.

## What Is Lag Putting?

Lag putting means prioritizing distance control over line. On putts beyond 20 feet, the goal shifts from "make it" to "get it close." Tour pros focus intensely on lag putting because they know the math: a 3-putt from 40 feet costs a stroke, while a comfortable two-putt keeps the round going.

The mental shift matters. Stop trying to hole long putts. Instead, imagine a 3-foot circle around the hole. Your job is to roll the ball inside that circle.

## The Biggest Lag Putting Mistakes

### 1. Leaving It Short

"Never up, never in" gets repeated for good reason. A putt that doesn't reach the hole has zero chance of going in. Worse, short putts often miss online because they slow down and break more at the end.

If you consistently leave lag putts short, you're either:
- Decelerating through the stroke
- Underestimating green speed
- Hitting the putt too softly to begin with

### 2. Blowing It Past

The opposite problem happens when you fear leaving it short. You hit it too hard, it races past, and now you're facing a tester coming back. Uphill putts can turn into 5-footers down the slope.

### 3. Focusing Only on Line

New golfers obsess over break. "Is it left-to-right or right-to-left?" But on a 35-footer, being 2 feet off on line leaves you with a makeable second putt. Being 8 feet off on distance creates pressure.

Distance is roughly 70% of the equation on long putts. Get the speed right, and you'll rarely three-putt even when you misread the break.

## How to Develop Lag Putting Feel

### The Pendulum Approach

Your putting stroke should work like a pendulum. The backswing length controls distance, not swing speed. A longer backstroke equals a longer putt.

Here's how to calibrate:
1. On the practice green, set up at 20 feet
2. Make 10 putts with no target - just feel the stroke
3. Note how far your putts roll
4. Adjust backstroke length (not force) to reach your target distance

This creates consistency. Instead of guessing how hard to hit it, you're matching stroke length to distance.

### The Look and React Method

Another approach: look at the hole, not the ball. Here's the drill:
1. Take your stance normally
2. Turn your head to look at the hole
3. Make your stroke while looking at the target
4. The ball will naturally roll the right distance

This works because your brain is excellent at distance tasks when it can see the target. Think about tossing a ball to someone - you don't calculate the physics, you just look and throw.

Practice this on the range first. It feels strange but produces remarkable distance control.

### The Walk-Off Technique

Before important rounds, walk the distance of your practice putts:
1. Hit a putt across the green
2. Walk to your ball, counting steps
3. Notice how far different stroke lengths travel
4. Build a mental database: 10 steps = small stroke, 20 steps = medium, etc.

This connects your visual assessment with stroke length.

## Reading Speed: The Often-Missed Skill

### Uphill vs. Downhill

Uphill putts need more force. The ball is fighting gravity the whole way. Downhill putts need less - gravity is your assistant.

How much adjustment? A general rule: add 10% for uphill, subtract 15% for downhill. Downhill putts are faster than uphill putts are slow.

### Grain Direction

Bermuda and other grainy grasses affect speed significantly:
- Into the grain: add distance
- With the grain: subtract distance
- The grass looks shiny when putting with the grain

This matters most in the southern US and tropical climates where Bermuda grass dominates.

### Green Speed That Day

Morning greens are often slower (dew). Afternoon greens are faster (dry, rolled for the back nine). Tournament greens are faster than practice greens.

Arrive early enough to hit at least 10 lag putts before your round. Calibrate for that day's conditions.

## Lag Putting Drills That Work

### The Circle Drill

1. Find a hole on the practice green
2. Set tees or coins in a 3-foot circle around the hole
3. Place balls at 30, 35, 40, and 45 feet
4. Hit one from each distance
5. Count how many finish inside the circle
6. Goal: 4 out of 4

This trains the exact skill you need - getting long putts close.

### The Ladder Drill

1. Place 5 balls at 25 feet
2. Hit the first ball to a target 30 feet away
3. Hit the second to 35 feet
4. Continue adding 5 feet each putt
5. The challenge: each ball must go farther than the last without a target reference

This develops feel for incremental distance changes.

### The Par 18 Challenge

1. Pick 9 spots on the practice green, all 25+ feet from holes
2. Putt each one, counting strokes like a round
3. Par is 2 putts per hole = 18 total
4. Track your score over time

This creates pressure and matches on-course conditions.

## Pre-Putt Routine for Lag Putts

Your routine for long putts should emphasize distance over line:

1. **Walk halfway to the hole** - Get a mid-point perspective on distance
2. **Look from behind the ball** - Take in the full length of the putt
3. **Make a practice stroke at the hole** - Not next to your ball, but toward the hole
4. **Feel the stroke size** - Is it a small pendulum or a big one?
5. **Commit to that size** - Don't change at the ball
6. **Execute** - Smooth stroke, let it go

The practice stroke toward the hole is crucial. It connects your visual assessment with your stroke.

## Mental Keys for Lag Putting

### Accept That Making It Is a Bonus

From 35 feet, tour pros make about 5% of putts. You're not trying to drain it. You're trying to eliminate three-putts.

This mindset reduces pressure. Instead of "I need to make this," think "I need to get this close." That's achievable.

### See the Ball Rolling at the Right Speed

Before you putt, visualize the ball rolling at the perfect pace. See it tracking toward the hole and dying right at the cup. That image programs your stroke.

### Don't Steer It

Long putts require commitment. Trying to guide the ball or steer it causes deceleration. Make a confident stroke and let the ball roll.

## When to Get Aggressive

Not every long putt requires a conservative approach:

- **Makeable length** (20-25 feet): Consider going for it
- **Nothing behind the hole**: Aggressive is low-risk
- **Match play or need birdie**: Risk/reward shifts
- **Perfect read confidence**: If you know exactly how it breaks, commit

But the default for 30+ feet should be: two-putt zone.

## Putting It Together

Lag putting is a skill, not a talent. You can develop it through deliberate practice. The key principles:

1. Distance control matters more than line on long putts
2. Stroke length (not force) controls distance
3. Practice specific lag drills, not just random putting
4. Develop a pre-putt routine that emphasizes distance
5. Accept two-putts as success from long range

Three-putts don't have to plague your rounds. With solid lag putting, you'll roll up to gimme range consistently and watch those wasted strokes disappear from your scorecard.

Start every practice session with 10 minutes of lag putting. Your scores will thank you.
