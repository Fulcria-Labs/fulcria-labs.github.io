## Best Irons in 2026: Detailed Reviews

### 1. TaylorMade P790 (2025)

**Best Overall Iron**

The TaylorMade P790 has defined the players distance category for years, and the 2025 version raises the bar again. It delivers tour-caliber feel with game-improvement forgiveness.

**What makes it special:**
- **4340M forged face material**: 20% stronger than previous generations, enabling a thinner face and faster ball speeds
- **Sweet spot increased 24%**: More forgiveness without sacrificing compact appearance
- **SpeedFoam Air**: Improved feel and sound while maximizing ball speed
- **Wider sole camber**: Better turf interaction from various lies

**Best for:** Mid-to-low handicappers (5-15) who want distance without sacrificing feel or looks.

**What testers say:** "The P790 proves you don't have to choose between distance and feel—you can have both."

**Price:** $1,400-1,600 (7-piece set)

---

### 2. Titleist T100

**Best Players Iron**

The Titleist T100 remains the gold standard for tour-level irons. If you demand complete control over your ball flight and don't need help getting the ball airborne, this is your iron.

**What makes it special:**
- **Forged from 1025 carbon steel**: The finest feel in golf
- **Compact blade profile**: Tour-preferred look at address
- **Minimal offset**: Clean appearance that better players prefer
- **Maximum workability**: Shape shots in any direction

**Best for:** Low handicappers (0-5) and elite amateurs who demand total control.

**Honest assessment:** If you don't hit the center consistently, the T100 will punish mishits. That's the trade-off for precision.

**Price:** $1,500-1,700 (7-piece set)

---

### 3. Titleist T150

**Best "In Between" Iron**

Can't decide between a players iron and something more forgiving? The T150 bridges the gap perfectly.

**What makes it special:**
- **4.5 mph faster ball speed** than T100 without massive head size increase
- **Muscle channel with polymer fill**: Lively feel with softer sound
- **Higher launch, steeper landing**: Better stopping power
- **Wider sole and topline**: More confidence at address

**Best for:** Low-to-mid handicappers (3-12) who want T100 looks with added forgiveness.

**Pro tip:** Consider a combo set—T100 in short irons for precision, T150 in long irons for launch.

**Price:** $1,400-1,600 (7-piece set)

---

### 4. Callaway Apex Ai200

**Best Players Distance Iron**

The Callaway Apex Ai200 delivers explosive distance with a forged feel that surprises everyone who hits it. This is Callaway's answer to the P790.

**What makes it special:**
- **AI-designed face**: Optimized for speed across the hitting zone
- **Forged 1025 carbon steel body**: Premium feel at impact
- **Urethane microspheres**: Dampen vibration for pure feedback
- **Speed Frame face**: Higher ball speeds on off-center hits

**Best for:** Mid handicappers (8-18) who want maximum distance in a players-looking package.

**Price:** $1,400-1,600 (7-piece set)

---

### 5. Callaway Apex Ai300

**Best Game Improvement Iron**

The Apex Ai300 delivers premium game improvement performance without looking like game improvement irons. Perfect for golfers who want forgiveness but don't want oversized clubs.

**What makes it special:**
- **Massively improved sound and feel** over 2023 models
- **Easy high launch**: Get the ball up without perfect contact
- **Exceptional rough performance**: Wide sole glides through thick grass
- **Consistent distance**: Minimizes the distance gap between good and bad strikes

**Best for:** Mid-to-high handicappers (10-20) who want help without bulky irons.

**Price:** $1,200-1,400 (7-piece set)

---

### 6. Callaway Elyte X

**Best for High Handicaps**

No iron in 2026 delivers more forgiveness, higher launch, and straighter shots than the Callaway Elyte X. If you struggle with iron contact, this is your club.

**What makes it special:**
- **Widest sole in class**: Impossible to dig
- **Deep cavity back**: Maximum forgiveness on mishits
- **Highest launch**: Gets the ball airborne even with slow swing speeds
- **Minimal distance loss on mishits**: Keeps your misses in play

**Best for:** High handicappers (18-30+), seniors, or anyone who struggles with consistent iron contact.

**What it won't do:** Shape shots or provide the precision low handicappers need.

**Price:** $1,000-1,200 (7-piece set)

## How to Choose the Right Irons

### Step 1: Be Honest About Your Game

| Your Typical 7-Iron | Iron Category for You |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| 170+ yards, shape shots | Players (T100, JPX 925 Forged) |
| 155-170 yards, consistent | Players Distance (P790, Apex Ai200) |
| 140-160 yards, some mishits | Game Improvement (Apex Ai300) |
| Under 145 yards, lots of mishits | Super Game Improvement (Elyte X) |

### Step 2: Prioritize What Matters

**If you value feel:** Mizuno JPX 925 Forged or Titleist T100
**If you want distance:** TaylorMade P790 or Callaway Apex Ai200
**If you need forgiveness:** Callaway Apex Ai300 or Elyte X
**If budget matters:** Mizuno JPX 925 Hot Metal

### Step 3: Get Fitted

Iron fitting matters even more than driver fitting. The right shaft, lie angle, and length can add 10+ yards and tighten dispersion significantly.

**What fitting determines:**
- Steel vs graphite shafts (graphite isn't just for seniors anymore)
- Shaft flex and weight
- Lie angle adjustments (critical for accuracy)
- Length modifications
- Grip size

**Where to get fitted:**
- Club Champion ($100-150 for full fitting)
- True Spec Golf (premium fitting)
- PGA Tour Superstore (free basic fitting)
- Local pro shops with launch monitors

## Price Guide: What to Expect

| Category | Price Range | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Premium** | $1,400-1,800 | P790, T100/T150, Apex Ai200 |
| **Mid-Range** | $1,000-1,400 | Apex Ai300, JPX 925 Hot Metal |
| **Budget** | $600-1,000 | Previous-year models, closeouts |
| **Used** | $300-800 | 2-3 year old sets in good condition |

**Pro tip:** Last year's models often drop 30-40% in price and perform nearly identically to current models.

---

## Combo Sets: The Smart Approach

Many golfers benefit from mixing iron models:

**Example combo set:**
- 4-5 iron: Apex Ai300 (easier to launch)
- 6-PW: P790 or T150 (control and feel)

This gives you maximum help where you need it (long irons) and precision where it matters most (scoring clubs).

## What About Your Swing?

Before investing $1,500+ in irons, make sure your swing isn't the limiting factor.

**Signs you might be outgrowing your irons:**
- Consistent contact, ready for more control
- Handicap dropped 5+ strokes
- Current irons feel "clunky" or oversized

**Signs irons aren't your problem:**
- Can't hit the center of the face consistently
- Ball flight varies wildly shot to shot
- Handicap is stagnant despite new equipment
