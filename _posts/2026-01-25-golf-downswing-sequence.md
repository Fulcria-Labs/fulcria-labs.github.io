  title: Golf Downswing Sequence Guide - How to Start Down Correctly
  description: Learn the proper golf downswing sequence. Ground-up power, hip initiation, and the kinematic chain explained with drills for more distance and consistency.

The downswing happens in less than a quarter of a second. You can't consciously control it in real time. But you can train the right sequence until it becomes automatic.

Here's what separates powerful ball strikers from everyone else.

## The Kinematic Sequence Explained

Every great golfer—regardless of their unique swing style—shares one common trait: the correct **kinematic sequence** during the downswing.

The order is always the same:

1. **Hips** initiate first
2. **Torso** follows
3. **Arms** drop
4. **Club** arrives last

This sequence creates a chain reaction that accelerates energy through each segment. The hips move, then slow down as they transfer energy to the torso. The torso accelerates, then decelerates as it transfers energy to the arms. The arms finally release that accumulated energy into the club.

This is how a 170-pound golfer generates 115 mph clubhead speed. It's not arm strength—it's sequencing.

## Why Sequence Matters More Than Speed

Swinging harder with the wrong sequence actually reduces clubhead speed. Here's why:

When you start down with your arms (the most common amateur error), you:
- Skip the powerful hip and core muscles
- Release the wrist angle too early (casting)
- Lose the lag that creates speed
- Hit weak, inconsistent shots

When you start from the ground up, you:
- Use your largest, strongest muscles first
- Maintain wrist lag longer naturally
- Create a "whip" effect through the chain
- Generate effortless power

The correct sequence isn't about moving slowly. It's about starting the right body parts first.

## The Transition: Where It All Begins

The transition from [backswing](/2026/02/20/golf-backswing/) to downswing is the most critical moment in the golf swing. And it happens before the backswing even finishes.

### Shift, Turn, Rise

As your backswing completes, three things happen in order:

1. **Shift**: Pressure moves into your lead foot (especially the heel)
2. **Turn**: Your hips begin to rotate open toward the target
3. **Rise**: Your body extends upward through the ball

This isn't a conscious three-step process—it flows as one motion. But understanding the sequence helps you practice it correctly.

### The "Bump"

Feel your lead hip move slightly toward the target as your first downswing move. This is often called the "bump." It's small—just a few inches—but it triggers everything else.

This lateral movement happens before the rotational movement. Bump, then turn.

## The Ground-Up Power Chain

Power in the golf swing comes from the ground up. Here's the complete chain:

### 1. Feet and Legs

As your upper body completes the backswing, your lower body starts moving toward the target. Pressure shifts into the lead foot.

**Feel**: Push into the ground with your lead foot, like you're trying to make a footprint.

### 2. Hips

Your hips begin to rotate open. By impact, they'll be 40-45 degrees open to the target line (for most golfers).

**Feel**: Your left hip clearing out of the way, creating space for your hands to pass.

### 3. Torso

Your shoulders follow your hips, but they lag behind. This creates the "X-factor stretch"—the shoulder-hip differential that stores power.

**Feel**: Your back stays toward the target slightly longer than you expect.

### 4. Arms

Your arms drop naturally into the "slot" as your body rotates. You're not pulling them down—they fall because your body is moving first.

**Feel**: Heavy arms that drop from gravity, not effort.

### 5. Club

The club arrives last, having accelerated through the entire chain. The clubhead reaches maximum speed right at impact—not before.

**Feel**: The club "lagging" behind your hands, then releasing through the ball.

## Common Downswing Mistakes

### 1. Starting With the Arms (Casting)

**The Problem**: Moving the club first loses all stored energy. The clubhead reaches its peak speed somewhere in the downswing, not at impact. You might swing "hard" but hit it short.

**The Fix**: Practice with an impact bag or old tire. Focus on driving your hips first while feeling like the club is the last thing to arrive.

### 2. Spinning Out (Early Hip Turn)

**The Problem**: The hips rotate before they shift laterally. This throws the club over the top and out-to-in, producing pulls and slices.

**The Fix**: The bump happens before the turn. Feel your belt buckle move toward the target an inch before it starts rotating.

### 3. Hanging Back

**The Problem**: Weight stays on the back foot through impact. Contact happens behind the ball's low point, causing fat shots or topped shots.

**The Fix**: At impact, your belt buckle should be past the ball, with most of your weight on your front foot. Practice hitting shots with your back foot pulled back and resting on its toe.

### 4. Early Extension (Standing Up)

**The Problem**: Your body straightens too early, moving your hips toward the ball. Your hands have nowhere to go, causing blocks and hooks.

**The Fix**: Maintain your spine angle through impact. Feel like you're keeping your rear end on an imaginary wall behind you.

### 5. Getting Steep

**The Problem**: The club moves too vertically coming down, creating a steep angle of attack. Leads to fat shots with irons and pop-ups with driver.

**The Fix**: Let your arms drop before rotating. Feel like your elbow drops toward your hip as the first move down.

## Drills for Better Downswing Sequence

### Step Drill

Start at address, then step your lead foot back next to your trail foot. Take your backswing, then step forward as you start down. This forces the correct weight shift sequence—you can't start with your arms if your foot is moving first.

### Pump Drill

Start your downswing but stop when your hands reach hip height. Pause. Then return to the top. Repeat 3-4 times before making a full swing. This grooves the correct first move without the distraction of hitting the ball.

### Feet Together Drill

Hit shots with your feet together (or very close). This forces proper sequencing because you'll lose balance if you swing with just arms. Your body has to stay connected and turn as one unit.

### Pause at the Top

Make full swings with a deliberate 1-second pause at the top of your backswing. This gives you time to feel the correct first move—the pressure shift and hip bump—before the swing accelerates.

### Medicine Ball Throws

Stand in golf posture and throw a medicine ball (or basketball) from your right hip toward a target to your left. The natural throwing motion mirrors the correct downswing sequence: hips, torso, arms, release.

## How to Practice the Sequence

Sequence training requires slow, deliberate repetition. Here's a practice structure:

### Phase 1: Awareness (5-10 minutes)
Make slow-motion swings without a ball. Feel each segment move in order. Pause at key positions. Count: "hips, torso, arms, club."

### Phase 2: Drills (10-15 minutes)
Work through the drills above. Focus on one at a time. Don't worry about where the ball goes—focus on the sensation.

### Phase 3: Integration (10-15 minutes)
Hit balls at 50-75% speed. Focus on starting correctly, not hitting hard. Good sequence at moderate speed beats bad sequence at full speed.

## How AI Analysis Helps

[Video analysis](/2026/02/17/phone-golf-swing-video/) can show you things you can't feel:

- Whether your hips actually start before your shoulders
- How much lag you maintain (or lose) in the downswing
- Your club path through the hitting zone
- Where your weight is at different points

Modern [AI swing analyzers](/2026/02/19/how-ai-analyzes-golf-swing/) measure sequence automatically, giving you objective feedback instead of guesswork. Many golfers think they're starting with their hips when video shows otherwise.

## The Bottom Line

The downswing sequence isn't something you can think about during the swing—it happens too fast. But you can train it until it becomes natural.

Key principles:
- The ground starts everything
- Hips lead, shoulders follow, arms last
- Bump before you turn
- Let the club lag behind
- Maintain your angles through [impact](/2026/02/28/golf-impact-position/)
- Let the [release](/2026/03/02/golf-release/) happen naturally at the end

Focus on sequence, and speed follows. The opposite isn't true.
