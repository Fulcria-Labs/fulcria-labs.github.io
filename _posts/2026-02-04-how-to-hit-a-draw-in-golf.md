There is a reason every amateur golfer wants to learn the draw. That smooth right-to-left curve (for right-handed players) looks pure off the clubface. It adds distance. It gives you options off the tee. And it feels like you finally cracked the code.

The problem is that most draw advice online overcomplicates things. You end up thinking about seventeen swing thoughts at once, and the ball slices harder than ever.

This guide strips it down. You will learn exactly what produces a draw, how to set up for one, and five drills that build the muscle memory so you can do it without thinking. Let's get into it.

## What Is a Draw in Golf?

A draw is a controlled shot that starts slightly right of your target and curves gently back to the left, finishing on or near the target line. For left-handed golfers, the directions are reversed.

The key word is "controlled." A draw is not a hook. A draw might move 5 to 15 yards sideways in the air. A hook can dive 40 yards offline and bury itself in someone else's fairway.

When people talk about wanting to "hit a draw," they mean a predictable, repeatable curve they can trust on the course.

## Why Golfers Prefer the Draw

The draw is the most popular shot shape on tour, and there are practical reasons for that.

**More distance.** A draw carries less backspin than a fade, which means more roll after landing. For the average amateur, switching from a fade or slice to a draw can add 10 to 20 yards off the tee.

**Lower, more penetrating flight.** In windy conditions, a draw bores through the air better than a high fade. It holds its line longer and gets knocked down less by crosswinds.

**Better positioning on dogleg lefts.** Right-to-left ball flight lets you work around corners and open up approach angles.

**It feels good.** A well-struck draw compresses against the face, launches with authority, and seems to gain speed in the air. There is a reason golfers chase this shot shape for years.

That said, the draw is not always the right play. A fade [offers more control in certain situations](/blog/how-to-hit-a-fade-golf/) and is less likely to turn into a dangerous miss. The best golfers can shape the ball both ways. But mastering the draw first gives you the foundation to build on.

## The Two Things That Create a Draw

Before you change anything in your setup, you need to understand the physics. Ball flight comes down to two factors at impact:

1. **Clubface angle** -- this determines where the ball starts. About 75 to 85 percent of the ball's initial direction comes from where the face is pointing at impact.

2. **Swing path relative to the clubface** -- this determines how much the ball curves and in which direction.

For a draw, you need:

- A swing path that travels from inside the target line to outside it (in-to-out)
- A clubface that is closed relative to that path, but still pointing slightly right of the target

Here is the critical part that trips most people up: the clubface should be open to the target but closed to the path. The ball starts where the face points (slightly right), then curves left because the face is closed relative to the swing direction.

If the face is closed to both the target and the path, you get a pull or pull-hook that starts left and dives further left. That is not a draw. That is trouble.

Understanding this relationship between [face angle and swing path](/blog/club-face-control/) is the single most important concept in shot shaping.

## Step 1: Strengthen Your Grip

Your grip controls the clubface more than any other factor. Most golfers who slice have a grip that leaves the face open at impact. To hit a draw, you typically need to strengthen it.

### How to Adjust

**Lead hand (left hand for right-handed golfers):** Rotate it clockwise on the grip until you can see two and a half to three knuckles when you look down at address. If you can only see one or two knuckles, your grip is too weak for a draw.

**Trail hand (right hand for right-handed golfers):** Position it more underneath the club so the V formed between your thumb and index finger points toward your trail shoulder, not your chin.

A stronger grip does not mean squeezing harder. It refers to the rotational position of your hands on the club. This position naturally squares or slightly closes the face through impact without requiring any wrist manipulation.

### How Much Is Enough?

Start small. Rotate your lead hand about a quarter inch and hit some shots. If the ball starts curving left, you are on the right track. If it hooks violently, back off slightly.

Most amateurs need a grip that is moderately strong, not extreme. An overly strong grip leads to snap hooks, which are worse than slices because they go further offline with more speed. If you start fighting hooks, our [guide to fixing the hook](/blog/fix-golf-hook/) walks you through the correction.

## Step 2: Adjust Your Alignment

This is where draw attempts usually fall apart. Many golfers aim their entire body at the target and try to manipulate the club to create curve. That does not work reliably.

### The Proper Draw Setup

Think of two separate aim points:

1. **Your clubface** aims at the target (or just barely right of it)
2. **Your body** -- feet, hips, and shoulders -- aligns to the right of the target, along the line where you want the ball to start

The difference between your body line and your face angle is what creates the inside-out path and the face-to-path relationship that produces draw spin.

### How Far Right Should You Aim?

For a gentle draw, align your feet and shoulders about 5 to 10 yards right of target. For a more aggressive draw, aim further right. The bigger the gap between body line and face aim, the more curve you will see.

Start conservative. A 5-yard draw is far more useful on the course than a 20-yard hook.

### Trail Foot Adjustment

Pulling your trail foot back about one to two inches from the target line can help promote the inside path. This is sometimes called a "closed stance" and it gives your arms room to swing through on the correct angle.

This small adjustment can make a surprisingly big difference, especially if you have been fighting an [over-the-top swing move](/blog/fix-over-the-top-golf-swing/) that produces slices.

## Step 3: Shallow the Club in Transition

The transition from backswing to downswing is where the draw is either made or lost. Most slicers get steep at the top, throwing the club outside the target line. This over-the-top move makes an inside-out path impossible.

To hit a draw, you need the club to [shallow in the downswing](/blog/shallowing-golf-club/), dropping onto a flatter plane as it approaches the ball.

### What Shallowing Feels Like

The best way to describe it: feel like your hands drop straight down from the top of the backswing while your hips rotate toward the target. The club naturally falls behind you and approaches from the inside.

If you feel like you are swinging "out to right field" (for a right-handed golfer), you are probably close to the right path. The sensation should be that the club is traveling toward one or two o'clock on an imaginary clock face around the ball, rather than toward eleven or twelve.

### Common Mistake: Starting With the Arms

The number one reason golfers come over the top is initiating the downswing with their arms and shoulders. This throws the club outward and creates the exact opposite of the path you need.

Instead, let the [downswing sequence](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/) happen from the ground up: hips first, then torso, then arms, then club. When you start with the lower body, your arms and club naturally drop to the inside.

## Step 4: Rotate Through Impact

A draw requires your body to keep turning through the ball. If you stop rotating and your arms take over, the clubface will flip closed too quickly, producing hooks instead of draws.

### What Good Rotation Looks Like

At impact, your hips should already be open (turned toward the target) by about 30 to 40 degrees. Your belt buckle should point left of the ball. Your chest should face the target at the finish.

The feeling is one of turning past the ball rather than hitting at it. Your arms are along for the ride while your body provides the engine.

### The Forearm Release

After impact, your forearms will naturally rotate, with the trail forearm crossing over the lead forearm. This is not something you force. It happens as a result of proper rotation and a square clubface.

Trying to consciously roll your wrists through impact is one of the most common draw mistakes. It creates timing-dependent hooks and destroys consistency. Let the rotation happen. Do not manufacture it.

## Step 5: Commit to the Shot

This might sound like mental game fluff, but it is genuinely technical advice. Indecision during the swing produces compensations. If you are not committed to the draw setup -- if part of your brain is worried the ball will go too far right -- you will steer the club, pull it left, and produce a pull or a slice.

Trust your alignment. Trust the face-to-path relationship. Swing along your body line and let the physics create the curve. The ball is supposed to start right. That is the plan.

## 5 Drills to Build a Reliable Draw

Reading about the draw is one thing. Training it into your swing is another. These five drills target the specific mechanics that produce consistent right-to-left ball flight.

### Drill 1: The Headcover Gate

**What it trains:** Inside-out swing path

Place two headcovers on the ground about a clubhead's width apart, just behind and inside the ball. The gap between them creates a gate your club must pass through.

If you swing over the top, you will hit the outside headcover. If you swing too far from the inside, you will hit the inside one. The gate forces a neutral-to-inside path.

Start with half swings and work up to full speed. Once you can pass through the gate ten times in a row, you have grooved an inside approach.

### Drill 2: The Alignment Stick Path Trainer

**What it trains:** Visual alignment and path awareness

Lay one alignment stick on the ground pointing at your target. Lay a second stick about two feet to the right of the first, pointing along your body line (where you want the ball to start).

Set up with your feet along the right stick and your clubface aimed at the left stick. Hit shots while maintaining this visual separation. Over time, your brain internalizes the alignment differential and you can reproduce it without the sticks.

### Drill 3: Right Pocket Drill

**What it trains:** Inside drop and shallowing

During your downswing, feel like you are driving your trail hand (right hand for righties) into your right front pocket. This sensation encourages the hands to drop to the inside rather than casting outward.

Hit 20 balls with this thought, focusing only on the feeling of the hands dropping, not on ball flight. The path correction will follow.

### Drill 4: Closed Stance Exaggeration

**What it trains:** The feel of an inside-out swing

Pull your trail foot back four to five inches from its normal position, creating an exaggerated closed stance. This setup makes it nearly impossible to swing over the top. Your body physically blocks the out-to-in path.

Hit 10 to 15 balls this way, noticing the right-to-left ball flight. Then gradually move your trail foot back toward neutral while maintaining the same swing feel. You are calibrating your internal sense of what an inside-out path feels like.

### Drill 5: Half-Swing Draw with a 7-Iron

**What it trains:** Face control and path together at manageable speed

Take a 7-iron and make smooth half swings (hands no higher than chest height). Focus entirely on starting the ball right and seeing it curve left. At this speed, you can feel the face-to-path relationship without the chaos of a full swing.

Hit 30 balls this way. If fewer than 20 draw, slow down and check your grip and alignment before continuing. Once you can draw 25 out of 30 half swings, extend to three-quarter swings.

## Drawing the Driver vs. Irons

The fundamentals are the same for every club, but the feel changes depending on what you are holding.

### Driver

The driver naturally promotes draw conditions because you are hitting up on the ball (positive angle of attack) and the ball is teed high. The ascending strike reduces backspin, allowing sidespin to take effect more easily.

Ball position should be forward in your stance, just inside your lead heel. Tee the ball so half the ball sits above the top of the driver face. Resist the urge to help the ball into the air. The loft and your upward attack angle handle that.

Many golfers find the driver is actually the easiest club to draw consistently.

### Irons

With irons, you are hitting down on the ball, which creates more backspin. More backspin fights against the draw spin, so you may need a slightly more pronounced inside-out path or a touch more face closure to see the same amount of curve.

Ball position moves progressively more toward center as clubs get shorter. A 6-iron might sit one ball-width ahead of center, while a pitching wedge sits right in the middle.

Short irons and wedges are the hardest to draw because their high loft generates so much backspin that sidespin becomes minimal. Do not worry about drawing your 56-degree wedge. Focus on drawing your driver, fairway woods, and long to mid irons.

## Common Mistakes When Learning the Draw

### Aiming Left and Hoping It Curves Back

Some golfers aim left and try to hook it back to the target. This produces a pull-draw at best and a pull-hook at worst. A proper draw starts right of target. If you cannot stomach aiming right, you will struggle with this shot.

### Flipping the Wrists at Impact

Trying to close the face by snapping your wrists through impact is the fastest way to produce inconsistent hooks. The face closes through proper grip and body rotation, not hand manipulation. If you are consciously rolling your wrists, stop.

### Taking the Club Too Far Inside on the Backswing

The inside-out path happens on the downswing, not the backswing. Some golfers drag the club inside immediately, which causes a stuck position and compensatory over-the-top move to recover. Keep your [takeaway on plane](/blog/golf-swing-plane-explained/) and let the shallowing happen in transition.

### Going Too Strong With the Grip

A stronger grip helps, but there is a limit. If your draws are turning into hooks that dive left of target, your grip is too strong. Weaken it a quarter turn and retest. The goal is a gentle curve, not a sharp turn.

### Stopping Your Rotation

When the body stops turning, the arms take over and the face slams shut. This is the classic "block and flip" pattern. Keep rotating through the ball. Your chest should face the target at the finish position. If it does not, you stopped turning.

## How to Use Video to Accelerate Your Progress

The biggest challenge with learning the draw is that you cannot feel what is actually happening at impact. It occurs in milliseconds. What you think your swing is doing and what it is actually doing are often two very different things.

This is where filming your swing becomes invaluable. Set your phone up behind you (down the target line) and record a few swings. Look for:

- **Club approach angle:** Is the club coming from inside or outside the target line?
- **Clubface at impact:** Is it pointing right of target (good for a draw) or left (pull territory)?
- **Follow-through direction:** Does the club exit to the right of target, or does it wrap left immediately?

AI-powered swing analysis tools can trace your path and face angle automatically, giving you numbers instead of guesswork. You might be convinced you are swinging inside-out when the data shows otherwise. Objective feedback shortens the learning curve dramatically.

## When to Play a Draw on the Course

Once you can hit the draw on the range, the question becomes when to use it during a round.

**Dogleg left holes.** The draw matches the shape of the hole, letting you cut the corner and shorten your approach.

**Into a right-to-left crosswind.** A draw riding a helping wind maximizes distance. A fade fighting that same wind loses carry and accuracy.

**When you need extra distance.** On a par 5 you are trying to reach in two, the extra roll from a draw can be the difference.

**Tight fairways with trouble on the right.** A draw that starts right and curves back to center keeps the ball in play and avoids the right-side hazard.

### When Not to Draw It

Avoid the draw when trouble is on the left (a hook is the draw's bad miss), when the pin is tucked on the right side of the green (a fade will hold better), or when the hole curves right (a dogleg right favors a fade).

Being able to work the ball both ways is the ultimate skill, but having one reliable shape you can count on under pressure is worth more than two mediocre ones.

## FAQ: How to Hit a Draw in Golf

### Can beginners learn to hit a draw?

Yes. The draw is not an advanced-only shot. Beginners with a slice are actually closer to hitting a draw than they think. Usually, the only issue is an open clubface. Strengthening the grip and adjusting alignment can produce draw ball flight within a single practice session.

### Is a draw better than a fade?

Neither is inherently better. The draw offers more distance, while the fade offers more control and a softer landing. Most tour pros have one preferred shape and use the other when course conditions demand it. For amateurs seeking distance, the draw has a slight edge.

### How far does a draw go compared to a straight shot?

A draw typically travels 5 to 15 yards farther than a straight shot with the same club, thanks to lower spin and more roll after landing. The exact difference depends on swing speed, launch conditions, and turf firmness.

### Why do my draws turn into hooks?

Hooks happen when the clubface is too closed relative to the swing path. Common causes include an overly strong grip, excessive wrist rotation through impact, or the body stopping its rotation while the arms keep swinging. Dial back your grip strength and focus on body rotation through the ball.

### Can I hit a draw with a slice grip?

It is very difficult. A weak (slice) grip leaves the face open at impact, which is the opposite of what a draw requires. You do not need an extreme grip change, but some strengthening is almost always necessary.

### Should I change my swing to hit a draw or just adjust my setup?

Both. Setup changes (grip, alignment, ball position) account for about 70 percent of the adjustment. Swing changes (shallower path, better rotation) handle the other 30 percent. The good news is that setup changes take effect immediately, while swing changes develop over time with practice.

## Your Draw Practice Plan

Here is a simple four-week progression to build a reliable draw:

**Week 1:** Adjust your grip and alignment. Hit 50 balls per session focusing only on starting the ball right of target. Do not worry about curve yet.

**Week 2:** Add the headcover gate drill and alignment stick drill. Focus on path. Hit 60 balls per session, alternating between drills and free swings.

**Week 3:** Combine path and face control. Use the half-swing drill with a 7-iron. Track how many draws you hit out of every 10 balls. Target is 6 out of 10.

**Week 4:** Take it to the course. Pick two or three holes per round where a draw makes sense and commit to the shot. Review your results after each round.

By the end of four weeks, you should have a draw you can call on when the situation demands it. It may not be perfect every time, but it will be in your toolbox.
