Choosing between SWEE AI and V1 Golf? Both are premium golf swing analyzer apps with AI technology, but they take very different approaches. Here's an honest comparison to help you decide.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | SWEE AI | V1 Golf |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Price** | $24.99/mo or $149.99/yr | $99.98/yr |
| **AI Analysis** | Yes - 50+ metrics | Yes - pose detection |
| **Recording** | In-app only | Import from camera roll |
| **Equipment** | Tripod required | Phone only |
| **Pro Library** | Tour pro comparisons | Extensive swing library |
| **Coach Network** | Yes | Large instructor network |

## SWEE AI: The Deep Analysis Option

SWEE AI launched in 2023 and has built a reputation for comprehensive swing analysis with over 50 tracked metrics. Founded by Coach Mal Tongue (30+ years experience), it emphasizes professional-level feedback.

### SWEE AI Strengths

**Deep Metrics**: SWEE tracks more swing positions than most apps - from setup through follow-through. If you want data on every phase of your swing, SWEE delivers.

**SWEE Index**: Their proprietary scoring system helps track improvement over time. It's a useful benchmark for your overall swing quality.

**Chippy AI Coach**: Their AI assistant (added in late 2025) provides personalized video recommendations based on your specific swing issues.

**Professional Backing**: Endorsements from tour winners and Top 100 teachers add credibility.

### SWEE AI Drawbacks

**Tripod Required**: The biggest friction point. You can't just pull out your phone and record - you need to set up equipment every time. User reviews consistently mention this disrupts practice flow.

**No Video Import**: You must record within the app. Can't analyze videos from your camera roll or that your friend recorded.

**Price Premium**: At $25/month or $150/year, it's among the most expensive options.

**Learning Curve**: Multiple reviewers note the interface takes time to learn, with limited built-in guidance.

## V1 Golf: The Industry Standard

V1 Golf has been the go-to swing analysis app for years, used by PGA Tour players and coaches worldwide. It's the safe, established choice.

### V1 Golf Strengths

**Proven Track Record**: More professional golfers and coaches use V1 than any other app. That experience shows in refinement.

**Extensive Pro Library**: Compare your swing to dozens of tour professionals. Visual references help understanding.

**Flexible Recording**: Import videos from your camera roll or record in-app. No tripod required.

**Coach Network**: Connect with certified V1 instructors for remote lessons. Large marketplace of professionals.

**Lower Annual Cost**: At $99.98/year, V1 costs about 33% less than SWEE AI's annual plan.

### V1 Golf Drawbacks

**Fewer Automated Metrics**: V1's AI analysis isn't as metric-dense as SWEE. More focus on visual comparison than data points.

**Coach-Oriented Design**: Some features feel designed for instructors rather than self-improvers.

**Interface Age**: While functional, the app design hasn't evolved as dramatically as newer competitors.

## Which App Is Right for You?

### Choose SWEE AI if:
- You practice at a dedicated location where setting up a tripod is easy
- You want maximum data and metrics about your swing
- You prefer AI-driven recommendations over manual analysis
- The higher price doesn't concern you

### Choose V1 Golf if:
- You want flexibility to record anywhere without equipment
- You value the ability to import existing videos
- You might work with a coach (V1's instructor network is unmatched)
- You prefer established, proven software

### Consider Alternatives if:
- You want even simpler, faster analysis - some apps provide feedback in 90 seconds without the complexity
- You want a fun experience, not just serious coaching metrics
- You're price-sensitive - free tiers and lower-cost alternatives exist

## Price Comparison Breakdown

| Billing | SWEE AI | V1 Golf |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Monthly | $24.99 | N/A |
| Annual | $149.99 ($12.50/mo) | $99.98 ($8.33/mo) |
| Annual Savings | 50% | N/A |

V1 Golf is the more affordable option annually, but SWEE offers monthly flexibility if you want to test before committing.

## The Recording Experience Difference

This is where the apps diverge most:

**SWEE AI**: Set up tripod → Open app → Record → Wait for analysis
- Pro: Consistent camera angles
- Con: Equipment hassle, interrupts practice rhythm

**V1 Golf**: Record however you want → Import or record in-app
- Pro: Grab any video from your camera roll
- Con: Angle consistency is on you

For range practice with dedicated setup time, SWEE's tripod requirement is manageable. For quick swing checks, playing lessons, or analyzing videos friends recorded, V1's flexibility wins.

## AI Technology Comparison

Both use AI, but differently:

**SWEE AI** emphasizes automated metric generation - numbers for angles, positions, timing. "50+ metrics" is their selling point.

**V1 Golf** focuses on pose detection and overlay tools. Less automated data, more tools for you (or your coach) to analyze.

Neither approach is objectively better. More metrics doesn't mean better improvement - it depends on how you learn.

## Our Take

For most amateur golfers, **V1 Golf offers better value**. The lower price, video import flexibility, and no-equipment-required approach fit how casual golfers actually practice.

SWEE AI makes sense for golfers who practice seriously at a dedicated location with tripod setup, and who genuinely use detailed metrics to guide improvement.

Both are premium options. If you're looking for something simpler and faster - [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) provides AI feedback in 90 seconds without equipment or complexity.
