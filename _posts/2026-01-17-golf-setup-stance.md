Every good swing starts with a good setup. It's the most underrated part of golf—boring to practice, easy to neglect, but absolutely fundamental. Get this right and everything else becomes easier. Get it wrong and you're fighting your own body throughout the swing.

## The Four Pillars of Setup

### 1. Stance Width

For a driver, your feet should be roughly shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. For a wedge, they're closer together—maybe hip-width.

Why? A wider stance provides stability for bigger swings but restricts rotation. A narrower stance allows more rotation but less stability.

### 2. Ball Position

This varies by club:
- Driver: Off your front heel (inside front foot)
- Long irons: Between center and front foot
- Mid irons: Slightly forward of center
- Wedges: Center of stance

Getting this wrong is one of the most common amateur mistakes. Too far forward leads to thin shots and [slices](/golf/swing-tips/2026/01/30/fix-golf-slice.html). Too far back leads to fat shots and pushes.

### 3. Weight Distribution

At address, your weight should be roughly 50/50 or slightly favoring your lead foot (55/45). You want to feel athletic and balanced—like a shortstop ready to move.

Don't fall into the trap of leaning back to help the ball up. This sets up a reverse pivot.

### 4. Posture

This is where most amateurs go wrong. Good golf posture means:
- Bending from the hips, not the waist
- Slight knee flex (not too much)
- Arms hanging naturally from shoulders
- Back relatively straight, not hunched
- Chin up (not buried in chest)

A quick test: at address, you should be able to stick a club along your spine from tailbone to head, and it should touch in multiple places.

## The Most Common Setup Mistakes

**Standing too close to the ball:**
Your arms are cramped, you swing too steep, and you can't rotate properly.

**Standing too far from the ball:**
You reach for the ball, lose balance, and tend to slice.

**Hunching over:**
Rounding your back restricts rotation and leads to back pain.

**Locking your knees:**
Stiff legs prevent proper [weight transfer](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/12/golf-weight-transfer.html) and [hip rotation](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/10/golf-hip-rotation.html).

**Gripping too tight:**
Tension in the hands travels up the arms and into the shoulders. This kills speed and feel.

## The Pre-Shot Routine Check

Before every shot, run through this quick checklist:
1. Feet aimed parallel left of target (for righties)
2. Ball position appropriate for club
3. Weight balanced and athletic
4. Posture from hips, not waist
5. Arms hanging naturally
6. Grip pressure light (5 out of 10)

This takes seconds once it becomes habit.

## Alignment: The Hidden Killer

Here's something that surprises most golfers: you should NOT aim your feet at the target. Your feet, hips, and shoulders should aim parallel left of the target (for right-handed players), like train tracks.

Your feet are on one track, the ball is on the other, and both tracks run parallel to your target line.

Many golfers unconsciously aim right with their body, which forces an over-the-top swing to get the ball back on line. Fix your alignment and the over-the-top might fix itself.

## How to Check Your Setup

Put a club on the ground pointing at the target. Put another club on the ground along your toes. Step back and look—are the clubs parallel? Most amateurs find their foot line pointing well right of their target line.

For posture, video yourself from the side at address. Compare to a tour pro. Are you more hunched? Standing more upright? Knee flex similar?

## Setup Is a Moving Target

As you get tired during a round, your setup tends to deteriorate. Posture slumps, stance narrows or widens inconsistently, ball position creeps around. This is why a pre-shot routine matters—it resets you to your baseline before every swing.

## The Mental Side

Setup is your last chance to think. Once you're in position, the swing should be reactive, not analytical. Use your setup routine to settle your mind, commit to your target, and let your body take over.

An AI swing analyzer can detect setup issues—stance width, ball position, posture angles—and give you feedback before you even swing.
