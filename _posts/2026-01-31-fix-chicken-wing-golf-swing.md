The chicken wing is one of golf's most visible swing faults. At impact, your lead arm collapses, bending at the elbow and pointing outward like a bird's wing. It looks awkward, and worse, it costs you distance and consistency.

If you've ever seen your swing on video and noticed that bent left elbow at impact, you're not alone. The chicken wing affects golfers of all levels, and it's often a symptom of deeper issues in your swing mechanics.

The good news: with the right understanding and targeted drills, you can eliminate the chicken wing and build the extension that tour pros display through the hitting zone.

## What Is the Chicken Wing?

The chicken wing occurs when your lead arm (left arm for right-handed golfers) bends at the elbow through impact and into the follow-through. Instead of the arm extending toward the target with the elbow pointing down, the elbow bends outward, creating that distinctive "wing" appearance.

A proper golf swing features:
- **Extended lead arm** through the hitting zone
- **Elbow pointing down** at impact, not out
- **Both arms stretching** toward the target post-impact
- **Natural fold** occurring well after the ball is gone

The chicken wing breaks this pattern by introducing an early, uncontrolled bend that robs your swing of power and precision.

## Why the Chicken Wing Hurts Your Game

### Power Loss

When your lead arm collapses, you lose the width in your swing arc. Width equals speed. A fully extended arm creates a longer lever, generating more clubhead velocity at impact. The chicken wing shortens that lever at the worst possible moment.

Studies on swing efficiency show that arm extension through impact correlates directly with ball speed. Tour pros maintain extension longer than amateurs, and it shows in their distance numbers.

### Inconsistent Contact

The chicken wing introduces an extra variable into your impact position. Every time your elbow bends differently, your club arrives at a different position. Sometimes you'll catch it thin, other times fat. The variation makes it nearly impossible to develop the reliable [impact position](/2026/01/25/golf-impact-position/) that consistent ball-striking requires.

### Directional Problems

A collapsing lead arm often pairs with an open clubface. The combination produces weak cuts and slices that miss right and come up short. Even when you do make decent contact, the lack of proper rotation means you're fighting the geometry of the swing.

### Physical Strain

The chicken wing creates stress on your lead elbow and shoulder. Over time, this can lead to overuse injuries. The swing is fighting itself, with muscles working against each other rather than in harmony.

## 5 Causes of the Chicken Wing

Before fixing the symptom, understand the cause. The chicken wing usually stems from one of these five issues.

### 1. Stalled Hip Rotation

This is the most common cause. When your hips stop rotating before impact, your arms have nowhere to go. The lead arm bends because the body isn't creating space for it to extend through.

Think of it this way: the [downswing sequence](/2026/01/25/golf-downswing-sequence/) starts from the ground up. Hips lead, then torso, then arms. When the hips stall, the chain breaks, and the arms compensate with a collapse.

Signs this is your issue:
- Your belt buckle faces the ball at impact, not the target
- Your hips feel "stuck" through the swing
- You have [early extension](/2026/01/30/fix-early-extension-golf-swing/) (standing up through impact)

### 2. Over-the-Top Swing Path

An outside-in swing path puts the club in a position where extension is difficult. The steep angle of attack and across-the-body motion makes it natural for the lead elbow to fold outward.

Signs this is your issue:
- You fight a slice or pull
- Your divots point left of target
- You feel like you're cutting across the ball

### 3. Poor Wrist and Forearm Rotation

Proper [release](/2026/01/25/golf-release/) requires the forearms to rotate through impact. When this rotation is missing or delayed, the lead elbow bends to compensate. The arm is trying to square the clubface by folding rather than rotating.

Signs this is your issue:
- Clubface is open at impact
- You feel like you're "steering" the club
- Grip pressure increases through impact

### 4. Fear of Hooking

Golfers who have battled hooks sometimes develop the chicken wing as a protection mechanism. By keeping the lead elbow bent and the face open, they prevent the over-rotation that causes hooks. It works in a sense, but it trades one problem for another.

Signs this is your issue:
- You've fought a hook in the past
- You hold off the finish intentionally
- You feel tension in your left arm at impact

### 5. Physical Limitations

Sometimes the chicken wing stems from flexibility or strength issues. Limited shoulder mobility, tight chest muscles, or weak rotator cuff muscles can all make proper extension difficult.

Signs this is your issue:
- You feel physical restriction when trying to extend
- The chicken wing appears even in slow-motion practice swings
- You have general upper body tightness

## 5 Drills to Fix the Chicken Wing

### Drill 1: The Headcover Connection Drill

**Setup**: Place a headcover under your lead armpit at address.

**Execution**: Hit half-shots while keeping the headcover secure through impact. The headcover falls out only well into the follow-through.

**Purpose**: This drill forces arm-body connection throughout the swing. You can't chicken wing if your upper arm stays connected to your chest. Start with easy swings and gradually build to fuller motions.

**Reps**: 20 balls per practice session until the feeling becomes natural.

### Drill 2: The Belt Buckle Rotation Drill

**Setup**: Take your normal stance without a ball.

**Execution**: Make slow swings focusing entirely on rotating your belt buckle toward the target through impact. Freeze at impact and check: is your belt buckle facing the target? Are your hips open?

**Purpose**: This addresses the root cause (stalled hips) rather than the symptom. When your hips rotate properly, your arms have room to extend naturally.

**Progression**: Once the feeling is clear without a ball, add a teed-up ball. Then move to balls on the ground. The priority remains hip rotation, with the arms responding.

### Drill 3: The Release Focus Drill

**Setup**: Hold the club with just your lead hand (left hand for right-handers).

**Execution**: Make smooth swings with just your lead arm, focusing on extending the arm through the hitting zone. Feel the arm stretch toward the target with the elbow pointing down.

**Purpose**: One-handed swings eliminate the trail hand's tendency to interfere with release. You'll feel what proper lead arm extension feels like without compensation patterns.

**Reps**: 10-15 one-handed swings, then immediately hit a ball with both hands while maintaining that extension feeling.

### Drill 4: The Trail Arm Throw Drill

**Setup**: Take your normal address position without a club.

**Execution**: Make a throwing motion with your trail arm (right arm for right-handers) as if throwing a ball toward the target. Feel how your body rotates to support the throw and how both arms extend through the motion.

**Purpose**: The throwing motion naturally produces the body rotation and arm extension you want in your golf swing. It's an athletic movement your body already understands. After several throws, grab a club and try to replicate that same throwing release.

**Reps**: Alternate 5 throws with 5 swings for 3-4 rounds.

### Drill 5: The Post-Impact Extension Freeze

**Setup**: Normal setup with a teed ball.

**Execution**: Hit the ball and freeze immediately after impact, holding the position for 3 seconds. Check your positions:
- Is your lead arm extended toward the target?
- Is your lead elbow pointing down, not out?
- Are both arms forming a relatively straight line toward the target?
- Have your hips rotated open?

**Purpose**: The freeze allows you to evaluate your impact and early follow-through positions. If you're chicken winging, you'll see it immediately. This self-check builds awareness and creates the visual feedback needed for change.

**Progression**: Video yourself doing this drill. Compare your freeze positions over several weeks to track improvement.

## Physical Exercises for Arm Extension

If flexibility or strength is contributing to your chicken wing, these exercises help.

### Chest Doorway Stretch

Stand in a doorway with your forearm on the frame, elbow at shoulder height. Lean forward until you feel a stretch across your chest. Hold 30 seconds per side. Tight chest muscles restrict arm extension.

### External Rotation with Band

Attach a resistance band at elbow height. Stand sideways to the anchor, elbow at your side, forearm across your body. Rotate your forearm outward against the band resistance. This strengthens the rotator cuff muscles that support arm extension.

### Wall Slides

Stand with your back against a wall, arms in a "goalpost" position with elbows and wrists touching the wall. Slide your arms up and down while maintaining wall contact. This builds the shoulder mobility needed for full extension.

Include these exercises 2-3 times per week as part of your [golf fitness routine](/2026/01/31/golf-fitness-exercises/).

## How Video Analysis Reveals the Chicken Wing

The chicken wing is a visual problem, which makes it perfect for video analysis. In face-on footage, the bent lead elbow is obvious at impact and into the follow-through.

Key frames to examine:
- **Impact**: Is the lead arm extended with the elbow pointing down?
- **Shaft parallel after impact**: Are both arms stretching toward the target?
- **Follow-through**: When does the lead arm finally fold naturally?

Compare your swing to tour player swings at the same positions. The difference is usually dramatic.

Recording your swing from multiple angles during practice gives you the feedback needed to track progress. What feels different often looks the same until the new pattern becomes ingrained.

[Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) can help you quickly identify the chicken wing in your swing. With 90-second analysis, you'll see exactly where your extension breaks down and can track improvement session by session.

## The Mental Side: Committing to Extension

Part of fixing the chicken wing is trusting the new movement. The old pattern feels safe, even if it's hurting your game. The new pattern feels strange and uncomfortable.

Commit to extension even when it feels wrong. The feedback from ball flight and video will confirm you're on the right track. What feels like "too much" extension is probably just normal.

Give yourself permission to hit some ugly shots during the transition. Overcorrection is often necessary before finding the middle ground. A few pulls and hooks while learning to release are part of the process.

## Putting It All Together

The chicken wing isn't just an arm problem—it's usually a body rotation problem. Fix the cause (stalled hips, poor path, restricted release) and the symptom often resolves itself.

Your practice plan:
1. **Diagnose the cause** using video analysis
2. **Choose the drill** that addresses your specific issue
3. **Practice the drill** for 2-3 weeks before expecting significant change
4. **Re-evaluate with video** to track progress
5. **Add physical exercises** if mobility or strength is limiting you

The chicken wing took time to develop. It will take time to unlearn. But with focused practice on the right drills, you can build the arm extension that produces more power, better contact, and consistent ball flight.
