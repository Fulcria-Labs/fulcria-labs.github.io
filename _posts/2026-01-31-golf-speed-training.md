Every golfer wants more distance. The good news? Speed is trainable. With the right approach, you can add 5-15 MPH to your clubhead speed within weeks—not months. Here's how the pros do it, and how you can too.

## The Science Behind Speed Training

Your swing speed isn't fixed. It's limited by two factors:

1. **Physical capability** - Your body's ability to generate force
2. **Neural governor** - Your brain's self-imposed speed limit

Most golfers have more physical capability than they use. Their brains simply won't let them swing faster because it feels "out of control." Speed training reprograms this neural governor.

**Overspeed training** is the key principle. By swinging something lighter than normal at maximum effort, you teach your nervous system that faster is safe. Your brain raises the speed limit.

This is the same principle sprinters use with assisted running (downhill or with bungee cords). It works.

## The Burst Training Method (2026's Hottest Trend)

According to GOLF Top 100 Teacher Bernie Najar, the most effective speed training involves short, intense bursts:

> "Hit six balls in a row as hard as you can, condensed into a two-minute window. This isn't about hitting it straight—it's about retraining your brain to accept faster swings."

**How to do it:**

1. Set up 6 balls at the range
2. Start a 2-minute timer
3. Swing as hard as you possibly can at each ball
4. Focus on maximum intent, not results
5. Rest 3-5 minutes between sets
6. Do 3-4 sets per session

The elevated heart rate and maximum effort create a training effect that moderate swings simply can't match. You're training your body and brain together.

**Important:** This is separate from your technique practice. Don't try to work on positions while doing speed training.

## At-Home Speed Training Drills

You don't need a range or fancy equipment. These drills work in your backyard or garage:

### 1. The Alignment Stick Whoosh Drill

Flip your club upside down (grip the clubhead) or use an alignment stick.

- Make full swings trying to create the loudest "whoosh" sound
- The whoosh should happen at the bottom of the swing, not before
- Do 10-15 swings focusing on maximum speed
- The lighter weight removes fear and lets you swing freely

This drill trains the "release" pattern that creates speed. Read more about [creating lag](/golf/swing-tips/creating-lag-golf-swing/) to understand why this matters.

### 2. The Step-Through Drill

Start with your feet together, club in position.

- Step forward with your lead foot as you start the downswing
- Let momentum carry you through—your back foot should come off the ground
- This teaches ground force integration
- Do 10 reps, then hit 5 normal shots

You'll feel how the lower body initiates the downswing. Check out our post on [tempo](/golf/swing-tips/golf-swing-tempo/) to see how this connects to overall swing rhythm.

### 3. Weighted Club Swings

Using a weighted club (or two clubs together):

- Make slow, controlled swings focusing on range of motion
- This builds golf-specific strength
- Do 10-15 swings as part of your warm-up
- Don't try to swing fast with extra weight

This complements overspeed training by building the strength to support higher speeds.

### 4. Non-Dominant Side Swings

Swing left-handed if you're right-handed (and vice versa):

- Do 10 full swings at about 70% effort
- This creates neural balance
- Many tour pros do this daily
- It also reveals swing faults you can't feel normally

## The SuperSpeed Protocol Approach

The SuperSpeed Golf training system has become popular for good reason—it works. The basic principle:

**Three weighted clubs:**
- Light (20% lighter than driver)
- Medium (10% lighter)
- Heavy (5% heavier)

**Basic protocol:**
1. 5 swings light club, maximum effort
2. 5 swings medium club, maximum effort
3. 5 swings heavy club, controlled
4. 5 swings with your driver, normal speed

Do this 3-4 times per week. Most golfers see 5-8% speed gains within 4-6 weeks.

You can DIY this with alignment sticks (light), a regular club (medium), and weighted donuts or tape (heavy).

## A Complete 4-Week Speed Training Program

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Day 1: Alignment stick whooshes, 3x15 swings
- Day 2: Rest or play golf normally
- Day 3: Burst training at range, 3 sets
- Day 4: Rest
- Day 5: Step-through drill + weighted swings, 3x10 each
- Weekend: Golf as normal (don't try to kill it on the course yet)

**Week 3-4: Intensification**
- Day 1: SuperSpeed protocol OR burst training
- Day 2: Rest
- Day 3: Alignment stick + step-through combo
- Day 4: Rest or light technique work
- Day 5: Burst training OR SuperSpeed protocol
- Weekend: Golf—now start letting some speed out

Track your swing speed if possible. Launch monitors or apps like Swing Analyzer can help you see progress.

## Safety Considerations

Speed training is high-intensity work. Protect yourself:

**Always warm up first.** A proper [warm-up routine](/golf/swing-tips/golf-warm-up-routine/) isn't optional before speed training. Cold muscles and max effort don't mix.

**Start at 80% effort.** Even during "maximum effort" drills, ramp up over 2-3 sessions. Don't go all-out on day one.

**Listen to your body.** Shoulder, back, or wrist pain means stop. Speed training shouldn't hurt.

**Rest between sessions.** Your nervous system needs 48 hours to adapt. More is not better.

**Maintain technique.** Do speed training separate from swing work. If your swing falls apart at higher speeds, back off and work on mechanics.

## How Long Until You See Results?

Be patient but expect progress:

**Weeks 1-2:** You'll feel more "freedom" in your swing. Your brain is adjusting.

**Weeks 3-4:** Measurable speed gains of 3-5 MPH are common.

**Weeks 5-8:** Speed stabilizes at the new level. Now work on controlling it.

**3-6 months:** With consistent training, 10-15 MPH gains are realistic for most amateurs.

The key is consistency. Three sessions per week beats seven sessions one week then nothing for a month.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Speed Gains

1. **Training tired.** Do speed work when fresh, not at the end of practice.

2. **Going for accuracy.** During speed training, ignore where the ball goes. If you're steering, you're not training speed.

3. **Skipping rest days.** Adaptation happens during recovery, not during training.

4. **Only doing light club work.** You need the full spectrum—heavy builds strength, light builds speed, medium transfers both.

5. **Forgetting to test.** Track your speed periodically. What gets measured gets improved.

6. **Ignoring flexibility.** Tight hips and shoulders limit your potential. Mobility work amplifies speed training.

## Bringing Speed to the Course

Here's the catch: range speed doesn't automatically become course speed. You need to trust it.

Start by picking one hole per round where you "let it go." Over time, expand this as your confidence grows.

The mental transition is real. Your brain built that speed governor for a reason. Convince it that faster is okay by building a track record of success.

See our breakdown of [swing speed vs. distance](/golf/swing-tips/golf-swing-speed-distance/) to understand how your new speed translates to actual yards.

## Train Smarter, Swing Faster

Speed training works. The science is clear, the protocols are proven, and the results speak for themselves.

Start with the burst training method this week—it requires no equipment and delivers results fast. Add the other drills over time.

And remember: you're not just training muscles. You're reprogramming your brain to accept that you're capable of more speed than you've been using.

That's a powerful realization.
