## Frequently Asked Questions

### How accurate are golf GPS watches?
Most modern GPS watches are accurate to 1-3 yards. That's plenty accurate for club selection. Rangefinders are more precise for pin distances.

### GPS watch or rangefinder?
**GPS watch:** Faster (always on wrist), shows all distances at once, tracks shots, works as everyday watch.

**Rangefinder:** More precise to specific targets, no charging needed, works everywhere.

Many golfers use both—watch for approach distances, rangefinder for pin.

### Do I need slope adjustment?
Slope shows "plays like" distance accounting for elevation. Useful but not essential:
- Required if your course has significant elevation changes
- Nice-to-have on flat courses
- Tournament legal only if slope is disabled

### Are monthly subscriptions required?
Most golf GPS watches require no subscription:
- Course updates: Free
- Basic stats: Free
- Premium features: Some brands charge extra

Check before buying if advanced analytics require ongoing payment.

### How often should I charge?
Depends on use:
- One round per week: Charge weekly
- Multiple rounds: Charge every few days
- Heavy smartwatch use: May need daily
