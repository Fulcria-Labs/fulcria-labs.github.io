If you've ever stood up through impact, felt "stuck" in your downswing, or wondered why you hit blocks AND hooks in the same round, you're probably dealing with early extension.

It's the most discussed swing flaw heading into 2026, and for good reason—research suggests **nearly 70% of amateur golfers** exhibit some degree of early extension.

Here's the complete guide to understanding and fixing this swing-wrecking move.

## What Is Early Extension?

Early extension is any forward movement (thrust) of your lower body toward the golf ball during the downswing.

Picture this: at address, there's a certain distance between your hips and the ball. With early extension, that distance shrinks during the downswing—your hips move toward the ball instead of rotating around your spine.

**The result?** Your arms and club get trapped behind your body, forcing your torso to rise up through impact. This creates a chain reaction of compensations that make consistent ball striking nearly impossible.

## Why Early Extension Destroys Your Game

The real problem with early extension isn't just one bad shot—it's that you get TWO different misses:

1. **The block right** - When your club gets stuck, you push it out to the right
2. **The snap hook left** - When you flip your hands to save the shot

Having two misses on opposite sides of the fairway makes course management a nightmare. You can't commit to one miss and play for it.

Beyond the directional issues, early extension also causes:
- Inconsistent contact (fat and thin shots)
- Loss of power (you're fighting your own body)
- Back pain (the spine takes extra stress)
- Difficulty compressing the ball

## What Causes Early Extension?

Understanding the causes helps you target the right fix:

### Physical Limitations
- **Hip tightness** - Can't rotate properly, so you thrust instead
- **Hamstring inflexibility** - Limits your ability to maintain posture
- **Core weakness** - Can't stabilize while rotating
- **Lower back restrictions** - Forces compensatory movement

A simple test: Can you do a full deep squat with your heels on the ground? If not, physical limitations may be forcing early extension.

### Swing Mechanics
- **Over-the-top move** - Creates a need to "make room" for the club
- **Open clubface at the top** - Last-second attempt to square it
- **Improper weight transfer** - Stuck on your back foot
- **Fear of hitting the ground** - Subconsciously standing up

### Mental
- **Ball fixation** - Trying too hard to hit "at" the ball
- **Speed seeking** - Lunging for extra power

## 6 Drills to Fix Early Extension

### 1. The Wall Drill (Basic)

This is where everyone should start.

**Setup:** Stand with your backside touching a wall, in your golf posture.

**Drill:** Make slow practice swings while keeping your backside against the wall throughout the motion. The wall provides instant feedback—if you thrust forward, you lose contact.

**Feel:** Your hips should rotate along the wall, not move away from it.

### 2. Trail Foot Torque Drill

This drill from GOLF Top 100 instructor Joe Plecker addresses the root cause.

**Setup:** Place a slider (or paper plate) under your trail foot.

**Drill:** Swing back to the top, then start your downswing. Halfway down, stop and push your trail foot behind you.

**Why it works:** You physically cannot thrust your trail hip toward the ball. This forces proper weight transfer to your lead side.

### 3. Head-on-Wall Drill

For golfers who stand up through impact.

**Setup:** Rest your forehead gently against a wall in your golf posture (no club needed).

**Drill:** Make practice swings without letting your head leave the wall.

**Feel:** If you early extend, your head will push off the wall. This drill builds awareness of your spine angle.

### 4. Belt Buckle Direction Drill

Fixes the "thrust toward target" pattern.

**Setup:** Place an alignment stick in the ground about 2-3 feet in front of your lead foot, angled 45 degrees left of target.

**Drill:** Feel your belt buckle extend toward 10 o'clock, not 12 o'clock. Your hips should rotate left of target, not drive straight at it.

**Key thought:** Rotate first, extend second.

### 5. The Two-Ball Drill

Monte Scheinblum's favorite for creating space.

**Setup:** Place two balls on the ground. Address the outside ball.

**Drill:** Try to hit the inside ball.

**Why it works:** Forces you to create room by rotating, not thrusting. You literally can't reach the inside ball if you early extend.

### 6. Split-Grip Drill

Creates proper body positioning through impact.

**Setup:** Grip the club with your hands separated—trail hand several inches below lead hand.

**Drill:** Make half-swings and hit shots. Hover the club above the ball at address.

**Why it works:** The trail hand position forces your spine into proper impact position—you can't stand up and hit good shots with this grip.

## Practice Sequence

Here's how to structure your early extension work:

**Week 1-2:** Wall drill daily (5 minutes), no ball
**Week 3-4:** Add trail foot torque drill with half swings
**Week 5-6:** Progress to full swings with two-ball drill
**Ongoing:** Use belt buckle drill as a pre-shot thought

## Physical Preparation

If physical limitations are contributing, these exercises help:

- **Hip flexor stretches** - 90/90 stretch, pigeon pose
- **Hamstring flexibility** - Standing toe touches, seated stretches
- **Core stability** - Planks, dead bugs, bird dogs
- **Hip mobility** - Fire hydrants, hip circles

Even 10 minutes of mobility work before practice can reduce early extension tendency.

## How Video Analysis Helps

The tricky thing about early extension is that **you can't feel it while you're doing it**. Your body adapts to the compensation patterns.

This is where video analysis becomes essential:

1. **Film from behind** (down the line view)
2. **Draw a line** on your hip position at address
3. **Check at impact** - Have your hips moved toward that line?

Using an app like [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) lets you freeze-frame the exact moment of extension and compare your impact position to your setup. You'll see the thrust clearly when you couldn't feel it.

## Common Mistakes When Fixing Early Extension

**Trying to stay back:** This often creates reverse pivot. You still need to transfer weight—just rotate while doing it.

**Locking up your lower body:** Some golfers freeze their hips entirely. You need rotation; you just don't want linear thrust.

**Over-focusing on the hips:** Sometimes the cause is actually the upper body (like an over-the-top move). Address the sequence, not just the symptom.

**Expecting immediate results:** This is a deep pattern change. Give it 4-6 weeks of focused practice.

## The Payoff

When you eliminate early extension:

- **More consistent contact** - You maintain your spine angle
- **One predictable miss** - No more two-way disasters
- **More power** - Proper rotation creates effortless speed
- **Less back pain** - Your spine works as designed
- **Better compression** - You hit down and through the ball

Early extension is the most common swing flaw, but it's also highly fixable with the right drills and feedback. Start with the wall drill, be patient with the process, and you'll see significant improvement in your ball striking.

Your body learned this pattern—it can unlearn it too.
