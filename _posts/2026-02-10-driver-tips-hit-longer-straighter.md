# 10 Driver Tips to Hit It Longer and Straighter

The driver is the hardest club in the bag to hit consistently. But it's also where you can gain the most strokes. These 10 tips will help you find more fairways and pick up serious distance.

## 1. Tee It High

**The Rule:** Half the ball should sit above the clubface at address.

Most amateurs tee it too low. A higher tee promotes an upward angle of attack, which is essential for maximizing driver distance.

**Why It Matters:**
- Launch angle increases
- Spin rate decreases
- Ball carries farther

Modern drivers are designed to be hit on the upswing. If you're teeing it low like your dad did in 1985, you're leaving yards on the table.

## 2. Ball Position: Forward, Not Center

Place the ball off your lead heel—that's left heel for right-handed golfers.

This position allows you to:
- Catch the ball on the upswing
- Make contact when the club is accelerating
- Launch it high with low spin

If the ball is too far back, you'll hit down on it like an iron. That creates excessive spin and costs you distance.

## 3. Widen Your Stance

Your driver stance should be wider than your iron stance. Feet should be just outside shoulder width.

**Benefits of a wider stance:**
- More stable base for a bigger swing
- Better rotation through the ball
- Increased power potential

But don't go too wide—you'll restrict your hip turn.

## 4. Create Tilt at Address

Your trail shoulder (right shoulder for righties) should be lower than your lead shoulder at setup. This "spine tilt" away from the target sets up the upward strike.

**How to check:**
- Look in a mirror at address
- Trail shoulder should be 2-3 inches lower
- Spine tilts slightly away from target

This isn't about leaning back—it's about positioning your spine for the optimal attack angle.

## 5. Swing Within Yourself

Here's the paradox: swinging easier often produces more distance.

**Why 80% effort works:**
- Better tempo and timing
- Cleaner contact
- More consistent clubface control
- Faster clubhead speed (yes, really)

Tour pros don't swing at 100%. They save max effort for specific situations. Copy them.

## 6. Focus on Rotation, Not Arms

Distance comes from body rotation, not arm strength. Your hips and shoulders create the power—your arms just deliver it.

**Key moves:**
1. Turn your back to the target in the backswing
2. Start the downswing with your hips
3. Let your arms follow the body
4. Finish with your chest facing the target

If you try to "hit" with your arms, you'll lose speed and accuracy.

## 7. Hit Up on the Ball

For maximum driver distance, you need a positive angle of attack—hitting up on the ball, not down.

**Target:** 3-5 degrees up

**How to feel it:**
- Imagine brushing the grass just behind the ball
- Feel like you're "launching" it off the tee
- Let the ball get in the way of your swing

Hitting down on a driver adds spin and costs you yards. Every degree up adds roughly 2-3 yards of carry.

## 8. Quiet the Lower Body in the Backswing

Excessive lower body movement in the backswing bleeds power. Your lower body should resist while your upper body turns.

**The feel:**
- Hips turn about half as much as shoulders
- Weight stays centered (not swaying right)
- You feel "coiled" at the top

This creates separation between upper and lower body—the source of real power.

## 9. Commit to Your Target

Indecision kills golf shots. Pick a specific target and commit to it completely.

**Pre-shot process:**
1. Stand behind the ball
2. Pick a small target (tree, bunker edge, not "fairway")
3. Visualize the shot
4. Address the ball without doubt
5. Swing to your target

Doubt creates tension. Tension kills speed and accuracy.

## 10. Match Your Driver to Your Swing

Equipment matters. The wrong driver shaft or loft can cost you 20+ yards.

**Consider:**
- Shaft flex matching your swing speed
- Loft appropriate for your attack angle
- Head design suited to your miss pattern

A fitting session costs $100-200 but can transform your driving. It's one of the best investments in golf.

## Putting It Together

Don't try all 10 tips at once. Pick 2-3 that address your specific issues:

| If You... | Focus On... |
|-----------|-------------|
| Hit it low | Tee height, ball position, spine tilt |
| Lack distance | Rotation, swing within yourself, angle of attack |
| Miss right | Rotation, commitment |
| Miss left | Stance width, lower body control |
