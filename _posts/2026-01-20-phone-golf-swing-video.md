You don't need a $500 camera, a tripod, or a film crew to analyze your golf swing. Your smartphone—the one already in your pocket—is more than capable of capturing video good enough for meaningful swing analysis.

Here's how to do it right.

## The Two Essential Angles

Professional golf instructors use two primary angles for swing analysis:

### Down-the-Line (DTL)
Position your camera directly behind you, pointed at the target. This angle reveals:
- Your swing plane
- Whether you're coming over the top
- Clubface position at impact
- Path through the ball

### Face-On
Stand the camera perpendicular to your target line, facing you. This shows:
- Weight transfer
- Hip rotation
- Head movement
- Posture throughout the swing

**Pro tip:** You only need one angle per session. Don't waste practice time constantly repositioning. Pick DTL for slice/hook issues, face-on for balance and rotation problems.

## Phone Settings That Matter

### Frame Rate
Most phones default to 30fps. Switch to **60fps** for better slow-motion playback. If your phone supports 120fps or 240fps, even better—but 60fps is plenty for swing analysis.

**How to change:** Settings → Camera → Record Video → Choose 1080p at 60fps

### Resolution
1080p is the sweet spot. 4K captures more detail but creates huge files and your phone's storage will fill fast. For swing analysis, 1080p provides plenty of clarity.

### Stabilization
Turn **off** optical image stabilization (OIS) for swing videos. The stabilization can actually make your swing look different than it is, especially during fast movements.

## You Don't Need a Tripod

Here's a secret that expensive golf apps don't want you to know: **you don't need a tripod**.

Many AI swing analyzer apps require tripods because they need the phone positioned at specific heights and angles. This adds friction, takes time, and interrupts your practice flow.

Better options:
- **Lean against your bag** - Prop your phone against your golf bag for a stable DTL view
- **Use a tee box marker** - The yardage signs on many courses work great
- **Ask a friend** - 5 seconds of handheld video is often enough
- **Use any video you already have** - Modern AI can analyze videos from any source

The point is to actually record and review your swing—not to achieve perfect cinematography.

## Distance and Positioning

### Down-the-Line
- Stand 8-10 feet directly behind the ball
- Camera height: belt level (chest height can distort the view)
- Make sure your entire body and club are in frame throughout the swing

### Face-On
- Position 10-12 feet away, perpendicular to target line
- Camera at waist height
- Center yourself in frame with room above for the club at the top

## What to Look For

Once you've recorded your swing, here's a quick checklist:

**At Address:**
- Feet shoulder-width apart?
- Spine angle appropriate?
- Ball position correct for the club?

**At the Top:**
- Full shoulder turn?
- Club parallel (or close) to the ground?
- Weight loaded on trail side?

**At Impact:**
- Hands ahead of the ball?
- Hips open to target?
- Head behind the ball?

**Follow Through:**
- Full rotation to target?
- Balanced finish?

## The Real Challenge: Seeing What's Wrong

Recording your swing is the easy part. The hard part is actually seeing what needs to change.

Your brain has a frustrating habit of seeing what it expects to see. You might watch your swing 20 times and miss the obvious shoulder slide because you're too focused on your grip.

This is where AI swing analysis shines. It doesn't have expectations. It measures angles, positions, and timing objectively—and tells you what actually needs work, not what you think needs work.

## Common Recording Mistakes

1. **Too far away** - If you can't see your hands clearly, move closer
2. **Backlit shots** - Don't record with the sun behind you
3. **Partial swing in frame** - Make sure you capture address through follow-through
4. **Filming at impact only** - The swing happens before impact; record everything
5. **Portrait mode** - Always record in landscape for swing analysis

## From Recording to Improvement

The best golfers record and review regularly—not just once a month. Make it part of your practice routine:

1. Hit 5-10 balls to warm up
2. Record 2-3 swings
3. Review immediately (or use AI analysis for instant feedback)
4. Work on one specific thing
5. Record again to check progress

The key is consistency. One recording per week for a year beats filming yourself 50 times and then never looking at the footage.
