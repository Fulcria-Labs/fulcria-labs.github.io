![What Your Divot Pattern Tells You About Your Swing](/assets/images/golf-divot-pattern.png)
Every divot tells a story. Most golfers ignore this free feedback, but divot patterns reveal exactly what's happening at impact - the moment that determines where your ball goes.

Tour professionals obsess over their divot patterns. Butch Harmon famously asks students to show him their divots before he'll diagnose their swings. Why? Because the divot can't lie. Your intentions don't matter - the divot shows what actually happened.

Learn to read your divots, and you can diagnose swing problems without any technology. It's the original instant replay, written in turf.

## Why Divots Matter

The divot forms at the exact moment of truth - impact. Three things create your divot pattern:

1. **Swing path** - where the club is traveling through the ball
2. **Angle of attack** - how steeply the club descends into the ball
3. **Low point location** - where the club reaches its lowest point relative to the ball

Understanding these three elements turns random turf scars into diagnostic gold.

## Divot Direction

After hitting an iron, look at where your divot points:

### Pointing left of target (for right-handed golfer):

Outside-in swing path. This produces pulls, pull-slices, and weak fades. Your club is cutting across the ball.

### Pointing right of target:

Inside-out swing path. This produces pushes, push-draws, and draw/hooks. Your club is traveling toward right field through impact.

### Pointing at target:

Square path. Combined with a square face, this produces straight shots. The goal for most golfers.

**Pro tip:** A slight rightward divot direction (for right-handers) often indicates a healthy draw swing. Many tour pros' divots point 2-5 degrees right of target.

## How to Check Divot Direction

Getting an accurate read requires proper setup:

1. Place an alignment stick or club on the ground pointing at your target
2. Hit your shot
3. Walk behind the divot and look down the line toward your target
4. Compare the divot angle to your alignment stick

Don't guess from address - walk behind and look. Most golfers overestimate how square their path is.

## Divot Depth

### Deep divots:

Steep angle of attack. Common causes: over-the-top move, poor weight shift, ball position too far back.

### Shallow or no divot:

Flat angle of attack. Could indicate good compression (if ball flight is solid) or thin contact (if shots are thin). Look at ball flight to interpret.

### Divot behind ball (fat shot):

Club bottoming out too early. Often from improper weight shift or trying to help the ball up.

### Variable divot depth:

If your divots vary wildly from shot to shot, you have a consistency problem. This usually indicates inconsistent [weight transfer](/blog/golf-weight-transfer/) or [setup positions](/blog/golf-setup-stance/).

## Divot Shape

Beyond direction and depth, pay attention to shape:

**Rectangle divots:** Clean entry and exit. Good technique.

**Tear-drop divots (wide then narrow):** Club is entering steep and exiting shallow. Often indicates good compression.

**Reverse tear-drop (narrow then wide):** Club is getting stuck, then digging out. Often a sign of early extension.

**Scattered/messy divots:** Club is bouncing or twisting through impact. Check your grip pressure and [clubface control](/blog/golf-clubface-control/).

## Divot Location

### Divot starts at the ball or after:

Correct contact. The club reaches its low point at or just after the ball, [compressing it into the turf](/blog/golf-ball-compression/).

### Divot starts behind ball:

Fat contact. The club is hitting ground before ball, losing energy and distance.

**The tour standard:** Professional divots typically start 1-3 inches in front of ball position. This is what creates that crisp "ball-first" contact you see on TV.

## Different Clubs, Different Divots

Your divots should vary by club:

**Wedges and short irons:** Deepest divots. Steep angle of attack is appropriate for maximum control and spin.

**Mid irons (6-8):** Medium divots. A balance of distance and control.

**Long irons and hybrids:** Shallow divots or "bruise the grass." Too steep with long irons produces weak, high shots.

**Fairway woods:** No divot or slight brush. Sweeping motion is correct.

**Driver:** No divot - you're hitting up on the ball from a tee.

If your wedge divots and 5-iron divots look identical, you're probably too steep with your long clubs.

## Using Divots for Diagnosis

| Problem | Divot Pattern | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----|
| Slice + deep divots | Points left, deep | Over-the-top with steep angle | Work on [shallowing](/blog/shallowing-golf-club/) and inside path |
| Hooks + shallow divots | Points right, shallow | Extreme in-to-out | Feel more "across" the ball |
| Thin shots | No divot | Early extension or hanging back | Get weight forward, stay in posture |

## The Range Test

At the driving range, use the divot patterns to track progress:

1. Hit 10 balls with your natural swing
2. Note divot direction and depth for each
3. Work on your intended fix
4. Hit 10 more balls
5. Compare divot patterns

**If your divots change, your swing is changing.** It's immediate, free feedback.

## The Line Drill

This classic drill uses divots to groove a consistent path:

1. Draw a line in the sand (or use spray paint/chalk on grass)
2. Set up with the ball on the line
3. Make practice swings aiming to create divots that run parallel to the line
4. When comfortable, add a ball

Most golfers discover their natural divot direction is 10-15 degrees left of target (out-to-in). The line drill provides visual feedback to straighten it out.

## Common Divot Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Judging from one divot**
One shot tells you little. Look for patterns across 5-10 shots. Everyone hits occasional outliers.

**Mistake 2: Changing the swing to fix the divot**
The divot is the symptom, not the disease. A left-pointing divot comes from swing path issues that start in the transition - not at impact.

**Mistake 3: Ignoring turf conditions**
Soft ground produces deeper divots. Firm ground produces shallower divots. Account for conditions.

**Mistake 4: Only checking on bad shots**
Check your divots on good shots too. Understanding what produced the good shot is just as valuable as diagnosing the bad ones.

## On-Course Divot Reading

Reading your divots during a round provides real-time feedback:

**After a great shot:** Mentally photograph that divot. That's your target pattern.

**After a poor shot:** Glance at the divot (don't stare) and note what was different. File it away for the range.

**Under pressure:** Don't change anything based on divots during a round. Just observe. The range is for fixing; the course is for playing.

## Beyond Divots: Full Swing Analysis

Divots reveal impact conditions but don't show the whole story. What happens in your backswing and transition determines what your divots look like.

A left-pointing divot might come from:
- An over-the-top move
- Open shoulders at impact
- Early hip slide
- Steep shoulder turn
- Grip issues

The divot shows *what* happened - video analysis shows *why* it happened.

AI swing analysis captures the full motion and connects your positions to your results. Film your swing, understand the cause-and-effect, then use divot feedback to verify your fixes are working.

The combination is powerful: video analysis for diagnosis, divot patterns for immediate feedback as you practice.
