Every divot tells a story. Most golfers ignore this free feedback, but divot patterns reveal exactly what's happening at impact.

Learn to read your divots, and you can diagnose swing problems without any technology.

## Divot Direction

After hitting an iron, look at where your divot points:

### Pointing left of target (for right-handed golfer):

Outside-in swing path. This produces pulls, pull-slices, and weak fades. Your club is cutting across the ball.

### Pointing right of target:

Inside-out swing path. This produces pushes, push-draws, and draw/hooks. Your club is traveling toward right field through impact.

### Pointing at target:

Square path. Combined with a square face, this produces straight shots. The goal for most golfers.

## Divot Depth

### Deep divots:

Steep angle of attack. Common causes: over-the-top move, poor weight shift, ball position too far back.

### Shallow or no divot:

Flat angle of attack. Could indicate good compression (if ball flight is solid) or thin contact (if shots are thin). Look at ball flight to interpret.

### Divot behind ball (fat shot):

Club bottoming out too early. Often from improper weight shift or trying to help the ball up.

## Divot Location

### Divot starts at the ball or after:

Correct contact. The club reaches its low point at or just after the ball, compressing it into the turf.

### Divot starts behind ball:

Fat contact. The club is hitting ground before ball, losing energy and distance.

## Using Divots for Diagnosis

| Problem | Divot Pattern | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----|
| Slice + deep divots | Points left, deep | Over-the-top with steep angle | Work on shallowing and inside path |
| Hooks + shallow divots | Points right, shallow | Extreme in-to-out | Feel more "across" the ball |
| Thin shots | No divot | Early extension or hanging back | Get weight forward, stay in posture |

## The Range Test

At the driving range, use the divot patterns to track progress:

1. Hit 10 balls with your natural swing
2. Note divot direction and depth for each
3. Work on your intended fix
4. Hit 10 more balls
5. Compare divot patterns

**If your divots change, your swing is changing.** It's immediate, free feedback.

## Beyond Divots: Full Swing Analysis

Divots reveal impact conditions but don't show the whole story. What happens in your backswing and transition determines what your divots look like.

AI swing analysis captures the full motion and connects your positions to your results. Film your swing, understand the cause-and-effect, then use divot feedback to verify your fixes are working.
