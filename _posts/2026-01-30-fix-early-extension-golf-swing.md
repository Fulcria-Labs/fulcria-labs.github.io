Early extension is one of the most common and destructive swing flaws in golf. If you've ever hit a block to the right followed by a hook to the left, early extension might be the culprit. The good news? It's fixable with the right understanding and drills.

## What is Early Extension?

Early extension is any forward movement (thrust) of your lower body toward the golf ball during the downswing. Instead of rotating around a stable spine, your hips push toward the ball, forcing your torso to stand up and your arms to get "stuck" behind your body.

**The result?** Two frustrating misses:
- **The block** (ball goes right) when your body outraces your arms
- **The hook** (ball goes left) when your hands flip to compensate

Having two opposite misses makes consistent golf nearly impossible.

## Why Early Extension Happens

Understanding the root causes helps you target the right fix:

### Physical Limitations
- **Tight hips, hamstrings, or lower back** - Research shows that any limitation in performing a full deep squat or hip bend can force early extension
- **Weak core muscles** - Your core can't stabilize your spine angle through impact
- **Poor mobility** - You simply can't maintain posture physically

### Swing Mechanics
- **Open clubface at the top** - Your body instinctively tries to close it by standing up
- **Over-the-top swing path** - Creates a chain reaction of compensations
- **Improper weight transfer** - Failure to shift weight correctly forces the thrust
- **Fear of the ground** - Subconscious avoidance of hitting the turf

### The Power Problem

Early extension doesn't just hurt accuracy - it costs you distance. When your hips extend toward the ball, you lose the stored rotational power that should transfer to the clubhead. You're essentially "spending" your power too early.

## 6 Proven Drills to Fix Early Extension

### 1. The Wall Drill (Chair Drill)

**Setup:** Stand with your backside touching a wall or chair back at address.

**Execute:** Make practice swings while maintaining contact with the wall throughout. Your glutes should stay against the wall from takeaway through impact.

**Why it works:** Forces your hips to rotate rather than thrust forward. You literally can't early extend when your backside is anchored.

**Reps:** 20-30 slow practice swings, then hit balls with the same feeling.

### 2. The Head-on-Wall Drill

**Setup:** Stand as if addressing a ball with your forehead resting gently against a wall. No club needed.

**Execute:** Make slow-motion swing movements while keeping your forehead on the wall throughout.

**Why it works:** If you early extend, your head will push off the wall as your spine angle changes. This drill gives you immediate feedback on posture loss.

**Reps:** 15-20 repetitions, focusing on the feeling of maintaining spine angle.

### 3. The Trail Foot Torque Drill

**Setup:** Place a wedge under your trail foot (right foot for right-handers), standing on the clubface with the grip pointing up.

**Execute:** Make half-speed practice swings. Focus on keeping pressure on the wedge throughout.

**Why it works:** If you early extend, your heel lifts and the club falls. Proper hip rotation keeps the pressure on the club. This teaches you to use ground force correctly.

**Reps:** 10-15 swings, building awareness of proper lower body action.

### 4. The Split-Grip Drill

**Setup:** Hold the club with your hands separated - trail hand several inches below your lead hand on the grip.

**Execute:** Make half-swings and try to make contact with the ball.

**Why it works:** The separated grip position makes it nearly impossible to early extend and still hit the ball. Your spine is forced into the correct position through impact.

**Reps:** Hit 20 balls this way, then transition to normal grip with the same feeling.

### 5. The Two-Ball Drill

**Setup:** Place two golf balls side by side, about 2 inches apart. Set up to the outside ball.

**Execute:** Try to hit the inside ball.

**Why it works:** Made famous by instructor Monte Scheinblum, this drill forces you to stay back and rotate rather than thrust forward. If you early extend, you'll hit the outside ball or miss entirely.

**Reps:** Hit 15-20 balls, focusing on the inside target.

### 6. The Belt Buckle Drill

**Setup:** Normal address position.

**Execute:** Focus on keeping your belt buckle pointing at or slightly behind the ball through impact. Feel like you're "covering" the ball with your chest.

**Why it works:** This mental cue prevents the premature hip thrust. Your lower body can still rotate powerfully while maintaining spine angle.

**Reps:** Use this thought on every swing until it becomes automatic.

## Physical Fixes for Early Extension

If your body is limiting your swing, these exercises help:

### Flexibility Work
- **Hip flexor stretches** - Lunge stretches, 30 seconds each side
- **Hip rotations** - 10-15 circles each direction, both legs
- **Hamstring stretches** - Essential for maintaining posture

### Core Strengthening
- **Planks** - Build the stability to hold your spine angle
- **Russian twists** - Rotational core strength
- **Medicine ball throws** - Power transfer through a stable core

### Practice Tip
Before each range session, spend 5 minutes on hip mobility and a quick plank. Your body will be better prepared to maintain posture.

## How to Know You're Improving

Signs your early extension is getting better:

1. **More consistent miss direction** - One-way misses are easier to manage
2. **Better ball striking** - More center contact
3. **Hip rotation feels different** - Spinning rather than thrusting
4. **Less back pain** - Early extension stresses the lower back

## Use Video to Track Progress

Early extension is hard to feel but easy to see. [Recording your swing with your phone]({% post_url 2026-01-22-record-golf-swing-phone-no-tripod %}) lets you see exactly what your hips are doing in the downswing.

Look for these checkpoints:
- **At address** - Note your hip distance from the ball
- **At impact** - Hips should be in the same position or slightly farther from the ball
- **Through impact** - Rotation around spine, not thrust toward ball

[Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) can help you track your posture through the swing, giving you objective feedback on whether you're maintaining your spine angle or early extending.

## Common Mistakes When Fixing Early Extension

**Don't overcorrect by hanging back.** Some golfers try so hard to avoid early extension that they keep their weight on the back foot. This causes fat shots and loss of power.

**Don't stop your hips.** Early extension isn't about stopping hip movement - it's about the *direction* of movement. Your hips should rotate powerfully; they just shouldn't thrust forward.

**Don't expect overnight fixes.** Early extension is often a physical limitation combined with a swing habit. Both take time to change.

## The Bottom Line

Early extension is fixable, but it requires understanding why you're doing it:

1. **Physical limitations** - Address mobility and strength
2. **Swing mechanics** - Use drills to groove proper movement
3. **Video feedback** - You can't fix what you can't see

Start with the Wall Drill and Split-Grip Drill - they give the most immediate feedback. Add the physical work if flexibility is an issue. And use [video analysis]({% post_url 2026-01-23-how-ai-analyzes-golf-swings %}) to track your progress.

Your lower back will thank you, and your consistency will improve dramatically once you stop thrusting toward the ball.
