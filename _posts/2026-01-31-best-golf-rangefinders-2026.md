- Works on any course without downloads
- Most accurate yardage possible

**Cons:**
- Requires line of sight to target
- Only one measurement at a time
- Slower than GPS

**Best for:** Players who want exact flag distance, competitive golfers

### GPS Devices
**Pros:**
- Front/middle/back of green instantly
- Hazard distances without aiming
- Course mapping and stats tracking
- Faster during round

**Cons:**
- Less accurate than laser (typically ±3-5 yards)
- Requires course maps and updates
- Battery life concerns

**Best for:** Recreational golfers, pace-of-play focused players

### Hybrid Devices
Get both in one unit. The Bushnell Tour Hybrid combines laser precision with GPS convenience—see front/middle/back while lasing the flag.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is slope really worth it?

Yes. Slope-adjusted distances are game-changing on hilly courses. A 150-yard shot playing 165 uphill requires a different club—slope tells you exactly what adjustment to make.

### Do I need the most expensive rangefinder?

No. The Precision Pro NX9 at $200 gives you 90% of what the $600 Bushnell Pro X3+ offers. The premium is for wind adjustments and superior optics—nice but not essential.

### How long do rangefinders last?

Quality rangefinders last 5-10 years with proper care. Bushnell is known for durability. Budget brands may have shorter lifespans.

### Can I use a rangefinder in tournaments?

Yes, with slope OFF. USGA/R&A allow distance-measuring devices in most competitions. Slope must be disabled (most rangefinders have a tournament mode).

### GPS watch vs laser rangefinder?

Different tools for different purposes. GPS watches are faster and more convenient. Laser rangefinders are more accurate. Many serious golfers use both.
