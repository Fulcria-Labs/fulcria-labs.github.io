You have probably heard the term "flying elbow" at some point. Maybe a playing partner pointed it out. Maybe you noticed it watching your swing on video. Either way, you know something looks off at the top of your backswing.

A flying right elbow is one of the most common swing faults among amateur golfers. It leads to slices, inconsistent contact, and lost power. The good news is that it is very fixable once you understand what is happening and why.

## What Is a Flying Right Elbow?

A flying right elbow occurs when your trail elbow (right elbow for right-handed golfers) moves too far behind your body and points away from your torso at the top of the backswing.

In a proper backswing, the right elbow should fold and point more or less toward the ground or slightly behind you. When it flies, it points more toward the target line or even away from your body entirely.

Picture it this way: if you took a photo at the top of your swing and drew a line from your right elbow, that line should point roughly at your right hip. In a flying elbow position, that line would point at your foot or even further behind you.

You can spot it easily on video. At the top of the backswing, there is a visible gap between the right upper arm and the torso. The elbow has disconnected from the body and moved to a position that makes the downswing much harder to execute.

## Why the Flying Elbow Hurts Your Swing

This is not just a cosmetic issue. A flying right elbow creates real problems that show up in your ball flight.

### The Over-the-Top Connection

Most golfers with a flying elbow are slicers. Here is why:

When your right elbow flies behind you, it gets stuck in a position that is hard to recover from. As you start the downswing, the elbow has to drop back down to your side. But gravity and momentum work against you.

The natural reaction is to throw the club outward with your arms to get it to the ball. This creates the dreaded over-the-top move where the club comes from outside the target line and cuts across the ball, producing a slice.

Our guide on [fixing an over-the-top swing](/2026/01/30/fix-over-the-top-golf-swing/) covers this pattern in detail.

### Power Leakage

A flying elbow also costs you distance. When your right arm disconnects from your body, you lose the leverage that creates power.

Think of your right arm like a catapult. It needs to stay connected and loaded against your body to release with maximum force. When it flies away, that loading mechanism breaks down. You end up swinging with your arms rather than using the power of your body rotation.

### Inconsistent Contact

With the club starting so far off track at the top, you need excellent timing to square the face at impact. Some swings you catch it flush. Others you hit it thin or off the heel. This inconsistency is frustrating because you know you can hit good shots, but you cannot repeat them.

## What Causes a Flying Right Elbow?

Understanding the cause helps you find the right fix. Several factors can create this problem.

### Incorrect Wrist Position

This is the most common culprit. When your wrists hinge incorrectly in the backswing, your right arm has to compensate by moving out of position.

Specifically, if you cup your lead wrist excessively (bending it backward) at the top, your right elbow tends to fly to accommodate that wrist angle. Flattening or flexing the lead wrist encourages the right elbow to stay tucked.

### Overactive Right Arm

Many right-handed golfers are naturally right-arm dominant. They want to lift the club with their right arm rather than letting the body rotation carry it back.

When the right arm takes over, it often lifts too high and pushes the elbow away from the body. The backswing becomes an arm swing rather than a body turn with the arms along for the ride.

### Grip Tension

Holding the club too tightly creates tension that travels up your arms into your shoulders. This tension prevents the natural folding of the right elbow and causes it to lift and fly instead.

You should be able to waggle the club freely at address. If your grip is so tight that the clubhead cannot move, you are setting up for arm tension throughout the swing.

### Limited Shoulder Turn

If you cannot rotate your upper body fully, your arms have to pick up the slack. To get the club to a full backswing position without adequate shoulder turn, the right elbow has to fly outward.

This is often a [flexibility issue](/2026/01/31/golf-fitness-exercises/) that can be addressed with targeted stretching and mobility work.

### Poor Takeaway

The seeds of a flying elbow are often planted in the first foot of the swing. If you take the club back too far inside or pick it up too quickly with your hands, the right arm gets out of position immediately.

A proper takeaway with the hands, arms, and body moving together sets up proper elbow position at the top.

## How to Fix Your Flying Elbow

Now for the solutions. These drills and adjustments have helped countless golfers get their right elbow back into position.

### Fix 1: Adjust Your Setup

Before you swing, make one simple adjustment at address. Turn your right forearm outward slightly so that the inside of your elbow (the elbow pit) faces the ball or even slightly toward the target.

This small rotation puts your arm in a biomechanically sound position. From here, your right arm can rotate and fold correctly without flying away from your body. It is a simple change that prevents the problem before it starts.

### Fix 2: The Headcover Drill

This is the classic drill for a reason. It works.

Tuck a headcover or glove under your right armpit at address. Make practice swings while keeping that object trapped against your body. If your right elbow flies, the headcover falls out.

Start with half swings and build up to three-quarter swings. You do not need to keep the headcover in place through impact, only through the top of the backswing. That is where the connection matters most.

This drill trains the feeling of keeping your right arm connected to your torso. Many golfers are surprised how different this feels compared to their normal swing.

### Fix 3: Right Elbow Down the Slot

Here is a thought that helps many golfers. At the top of your backswing, imagine your right elbow pointing at your right hip pocket.

This is not exactly what happens in a good swing, but the image prevents the elbow from flying toward the target line. If you feel like your elbow is pointing down, it is probably in the correct position.

Another helpful image: picture your right elbow connected to your right hip by a string. As you make your backswing, the string stays taut but not tight. Your elbow cannot fly because the imaginary string pulls it back.

### Fix 4: The Wall Drill

Stand with your back about 18 inches from a wall. Make your backswing. If your right elbow hits the wall, it is flying.

This gives you immediate physical feedback. Practice until you can make a full backswing without touching the wall. The drill constrains your movement and teaches your body a new pattern.

Start very slowly. The point is awareness, not speed. Once you can do it slowly without contact, gradually increase your tempo.

### Fix 5: Focus on Your Lead Wrist

Often the right elbow fix comes from working on the left wrist. Flatten your lead wrist at the top of the swing rather than letting it cup.

To feel this, make a fist with your left hand and rotate it so your knuckles face upward. Now bend your wrist so your knuckles point more toward the sky. That is a cupped position. Rotate them so they point more toward the ground. That is flat or flexed.

A flat lead wrist position creates space for your right elbow to stay tucked. A cupped position forces the right elbow to fly to accommodate the angle. Work on your [wrist hinge](/2026/01/30/golf-wrist-hinge-guide/) to get this relationship right.

### Fix 6: Slow Down Your Backswing

Rushing the takeaway forces your arms to do the work instead of your body. When the arms race ahead of the rotation, the right elbow flies.

Focus on a slow, smooth takeaway where your shoulders control the motion. Let your arms stay passive and connected. A slower backswing gives you time to feel the correct positions.

Many golfers find that when they slow down to 70% of their normal speed, the flying elbow disappears. That tells you the problem is sequencing, not mechanics. Your body knows what to do when it has time to do it correctly.

## Check Your Progress with Video

You cannot feel your right elbow position accurately. What feels tucked might still be flying. What feels like a huge change might look barely different on camera.

Recording your swing is essential for fixing a flying elbow. Set up your phone or camera behind you, pointing down the target line. Film yourself making swings and watch specifically for your right elbow position at the top.

Draw a line on the screen from your right elbow. Does it point at your hip or behind it? Compare your before and after as you work through these drills.

AI-powered analysis can identify this fault automatically and track your improvement over time. Getting objective feedback removes the guesswork from practice.

## Training Aids That Help

Several training aids are designed specifically for this issue.

Connection straps wrap around your arms and torso, preventing them from separating during the swing. They give instant feedback when your elbow starts to fly.

Impact bags and foam rollers placed at your right hip can be used to feel the right elbow dropping into position during the downswing. The physical target gives you something to aim for.

Even a simple resistance band looped around both arms can help build the connected feeling you need.

## What About Jack Nicklaus?

You might have heard that Jack Nicklaus had a flying elbow and won 18 majors with it. This is true. It is also misleading.

Nicklaus did have a slightly higher right elbow position than textbook form suggests. But his incredible timing, athleticism, and fundamentals everywhere else allowed him to make it work. His flying elbow was also less severe than what most amateur golfers produce.

For most golfers, fixing the flying elbow will lead to better results. You can always keep a slight flying tendency if it works for you, but you need solid fundamentals everywhere else to compensate.

The advice to fix your flying elbow is not about achieving perfect form. It is about removing a fault that makes the swing harder than it needs to be.

## A Practice Plan for the Flying Elbow

Here is a four-week plan to fix this fault for good.

**Week 1: Awareness**
Record your swing from down the line. Identify how severe your flying elbow is. Practice the headcover drill for 10 minutes daily, making slow-motion swings. Do not hit balls yet.

**Week 2: Pattern Building**
Continue the headcover drill. Add the wall drill. Start hitting balls at 50% speed, focusing only on keeping your right arm connected. Do not worry about where the ball goes. Record at the end of the week to check progress.

**Week 3: Integration**
Increase swing speed to 75%. Hit balls normally but do three practice swings with a focus on the right elbow before each shot. Alternate between using the headcover and swinging freely.

**Week 4: Solidify**
Swing at full speed. Before each range session, do 20 headcover drill swings as a warm-up. Record your swing and compare to Week 1. You should see noticeable improvement.

After four weeks, the new pattern should feel more natural. Continue with periodic check-ins using video to make sure old habits do not creep back.

## Key Takeaways

A flying right elbow is a common fault that causes slices, lost power, and inconsistency. Fixing it requires understanding why it happens and practicing specific drills to build new patterns.

Remember these points:

1. Set up with your right elbow pit facing the ball
2. Use the headcover drill to feel connection
3. Slow your backswing to let your body lead
4. Check your lead wrist position at the top
5. Use video to track your progress

Your right elbow should work with your body, not fly away from it. When it stays connected, you will hit straighter, more powerful shots with less effort.

The best swings look effortless because the body works as a unit. Getting your right elbow under control is a big step toward that kind of connected, powerful motion.
