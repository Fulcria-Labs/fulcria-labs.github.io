# How to Fix a Golf Hook: 7 Proven Drills and Fixes

A hook might feel better off the clubface than a slice—at least you're hitting it solid—but a ball that starts right and dives left into the trees is just as costly as one that slices the other way.

The frustrating part? Many golfers develop a hook *after* they've fixed their slice, turning one problem into another. Let's break down why hooks happen and how to straighten them out.

## What Causes a Golf Hook?

A hook happens when the clubface is closed relative to your swing path at impact. Unlike a slice (open face + out-to-in path), a hook combines:

- **Clubface significantly closed** to the target line
- **Swing path from inside** (which is actually good—you just need to match face to path)

The ball starts right of your target (for right-handed golfers), then curves sharply left. The more closed the face relative to path, the more severe the curve.

### Hook vs. Draw vs. Snap Hook

- **Draw**: Slight right-to-left movement, lands near target
- **Hook**: Excessive curve, misses left of target
- **Snap Hook / Duck Hook**: Severe, low curve that dives quickly—often from an extremely closed face

## The 7 Most Common Hook Causes

### 1. Grip Too Strong

The most frequent hook cause. When both hands rotate too far clockwise on the grip (for right-handers), the face naturally closes through impact.

**Check yourself**: Look down at your grip. If you can see 3-4 knuckles on your left hand, your grip is too strong.

**The fix**: Rotate both hands slightly counterclockwise until you see only 2 knuckles on your left hand. This feels weak at first but allows the face to stay more square.

### 2. Clubface Closed at Address

If you set up with the clubface already closed, you're pre-programming a hook before you even swing.

**Check yourself**: At address, the leading edge should be perpendicular to your target line, not aimed left.

**The fix**: Use alignment sticks in practice. Set one for your target line and consciously square the face to it.

### 3. Overactive Hands Through Impact

Rolling your hands over too aggressively through the hitting zone closes the face rapidly. This often comes from the old advice to "release" the club, taken too far.

**Check yourself**: In slow-motion video, watch if your forearms rotate excessively through impact.

**The fix**: Practice the "logo up" drill—keep the logo on your glove facing the sky longer through impact.

### 4. Body Stalling, Hands Flipping

When your body rotation stops, your hands take over. Active hands without body rotation = rapid face closure.

**Check yourself**: At the finish, is your belt buckle facing the target? If not, you stalled.

**The fix**: Focus on continuous rotation through the ball. Feel like your chest beats your hands to the finish.

### 5. Ball Position Too Far Back

A ball positioned too far back in your stance forces you to catch it earlier in the swing arc—when the face is still closing.

**Check yourself**: For driver, ball should be just inside your lead heel. For irons, progressively more centered.

**The fix**: Use a ball position check in every practice session. [Read our ball position guide](/golf-ball-position-guide/) for proper placement with each club.

### 6. Swing Path Too Far From Inside

An exaggerated inside-out path isn't bad by itself—it's what creates a draw. But when the face doesn't match, you get hooks.

**Check yourself**: In video, does your club approach the ball from well inside? Do your divots point right?

**The fix**: You don't necessarily need to change your path—just match your face to it better. A slightly more neutral path can also help.

### 7. Tension in Forearms and Hands

Grip pressure that's too tight causes the forearms to activate, rotating the face closed.

**Check yourself**: Rate your grip pressure 1-10. If it's above 4-5, you're probably too tight.

**The fix**: Lighten your grip, especially with the trail hand. Sam Snead's famous advice: hold the club like you're holding a small bird.

## 7 Drills to Fix Your Hook

### Drill 1: The Split-Grip Drill

Separate your hands 2-3 inches apart on the grip and hit short shots. This prevents the hands from rolling over too quickly.

**How to do it**:
- Place your lead hand in normal position
- Drop your trail hand 2-3 inches lower
- Make 50-75% swings focusing on keeping the face stable

### Drill 2: Glove Under Trail Arm

Tuck a glove or headcover under your trail armpit. If it falls before impact, you're getting "disconnected"—which leads to flippy hands.

**How to do it**:
- Tuck object under trail arm at address
- Make swings keeping it in place through impact
- Focus on body rotation rather than arm action

### Drill 3: Alignment Stick in Belt Loop

Thread an alignment stick through your lead-side belt loop, pointing at the target. Through impact, rotate until the stick points left of target.

**Why it works**: Forces full body rotation, preventing the stall that causes hand flip.

### Drill 4: Trail Arm Only Swings

Make slow-motion swings with just your trail hand. Focus on keeping the palm facing the sky longer through impact.

**Why it works**: Trains the trail arm to extend rather than rotate, which squares (rather than closes) the face.

### Drill 5: Ball Position Check

Place two alignment sticks on the ground—one for target line, one perpendicular for ball position. Hit shots from correct positions for each club.

**Why it works**: Ensures you're not positioning the ball too far back, which catches the face while it's still closing.

### Drill 6: The Pause Drill

Make a normal backswing, pause 2 seconds at the top, then swing through. This breaks the tension pattern that causes hooks.

**Why it works**: Eliminates the quick, handsy transition that throws timing off.

### Drill 7: Aim the Handle Drill

At impact, focus on the butt of the club pointing at your belt buckle, not behind you. This keeps the face from closing too quickly.

**Why it works**: Maintains proper shaft angle through impact, preventing flip.

## Common Mistakes When Fixing a Hook

### Don't Weaken Your Grip Too Much

Going from a strong grip to a weak grip often trades a hook for a slice. Make small adjustments—one knuckle at a time.

### Don't Aim Right to Compensate

Aiming right and playing the hook just grooves a bad pattern. Fix the cause instead of managing the symptom.

### Don't Forget the Cause Hierarchy

Check grip first, then setup, then swing. Most hooks start in the grip—you might not need to change your swing at all.

## Using Video to Diagnose Your Hook

Recording your swing reveals what you can't feel:

1. **Face-on view**: Check ball position and hand rotation through impact
2. **Down-the-line view**: Check swing path and face angle at address
3. **Slow motion**: Watch forearm rotation through the hitting zone

[Recording your swing with your phone](/phone-golf-swing-video/) takes 30 seconds and shows exactly why you're hooking.

## When to See a Professional

If you've tried these fixes for 3-4 practice sessions without improvement:

- A lesson can identify your specific hook cause in minutes
- Equipment fitting might reveal ill-fitted clubs (lie angle, shaft flex)
- Custom fitting ensures your fixes aren't fighting your equipment

## Quick Reference: Hook Fix Checklist

| Symptom | Likely Cause | First Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Low, diving hook | Extremely closed face | Check grip strength |
| High hook | Closed face + path issue | Ball position + rotation |
| Hook with driver only | Driver setup different | Ball forward + tee height |
| Hook with irons only | Divots pointing right | Match face to path |
| Inconsistent hooks | Grip pressure changes | Lighter, consistent grip |

## The Bottom Line

Hooks come from a clubface that's closed relative to your swing path. Unlike slices, you already have the valuable inside-out path—you just need to match your face to it.

Start with the grip. More than half of hook problems are solved there. Then check ball position and setup before making swing changes. Small adjustments, made consistently, will straighten that hook into a controlled draw.
