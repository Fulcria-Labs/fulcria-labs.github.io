Android users have excellent options for golf swing analysis - you just need to know which apps actually work on your device.

The good news? Modern Android flagships (Samsung Galaxy, Pixel, OnePlus) have incredible cameras with slow-motion capabilities up to 960fps. The question is: which app takes full advantage of that hardware?

We tested 7 golf swing analyzer apps on Android and ranked them for real-world use. Here's what we found.

## Our Top 3 Picks for Android

### Best Overall: Swing Analyzer

**Why it wins:** 90-second AI analysis on any Android phone. No waiting hours for feedback - you get results while you're still at the range. Works without a tripod, which matters when you don't want to haul extra gear.

**Key features:**
- Instant AI grading with letter grades (A-F)
- Handicap prediction that's surprisingly accurate
- No tripod needed - works with phone propped up
- Clean interface that doesn't require a tutorial

**Price:** Free tier available, premium for advanced features

**Best for:** Android users who want immediate, actionable feedback without complexity.

**Android note:** Works smoothly on most devices running Android 10+. Optimized for Samsung Galaxy and Pixel cameras.

### Best for Coach Integration: V1 Golf

**Why it's great:** The industry standard for lesson sharing. If your instructor uses V1 (most PGA pros do), this makes remote lessons seamless. The Android version has full feature parity with iOS.

**Key features:**
- Drawing tools for swing markup
- Split-screen comparison with tour pros
- Voice-over lesson recordings
- Shared libraries between student and coach

**Price:** $99/year

**Best for:** Golfers working with a teaching pro who want to share swings between sessions.

**Limitation:** AI analysis is basic - it's designed for human coaches to add value.

---

### Best Free Option: GolfFix AI

**Why it's great:** Korean-developed app with a genuinely useful free tier. Detects 45+ swing issues using AI and is used in 63 countries. For $0, the analysis quality is impressive.

**Key features:**
- Free AI swing analysis (not just a demo)
- Detailed issue detection (early extension, casting, sway, etc.)
- Before/after comparison tools
- Works on mid-range Android devices

**Price:** Free (with optional premium upgrades)

**Best for:** Budget-conscious golfers who want AI analysis without paying.

**Limitation:** Interface isn't as polished as premium options. Some features feel translated.

---

## The Rest, Ranked

### 4. 18Birdies ($99/year)

Primarily a GPS rangefinder and stat tracker that includes swing analysis. Good if you want one app for everything on the course. The swing analyzer isn't as deep as dedicated options, but the all-in-one value is solid.

**Android note:** Works well, though battery drain can be high with GPS running.

### 5. SWEE AI ($150/year)

Detailed metrics and clean interface. Requires a tripod setup for best results, which adds friction. Android version works but some users report occasional sync issues.

**Android note:** Performance varies by device. Works best on flagship phones.

### 6. Hudl Technique (Free)

Originally built for coaches across multiple sports. Excellent drawing and annotation tools. No AI analysis - you're doing the work yourself. But if you just want slow-mo video with markup, it's free and capable.

**Android note:** Reliable on most devices. Simple and lightweight.

### 7. Golf Swing Analyzer (Free)

Basic but functional. Records your swing and lets you draw lines on it. No AI, limited features, but it works. Good entry point if you've never used a swing analyzer.

**Android note:** Works on older Android devices where other apps struggle.

## Android-Specific Considerations

### Camera Quality Matters

Not all Android phones are equal. For best results:

**Excellent:** Samsung Galaxy S24/S23, Pixel 8 Pro, OnePlus 12
**Good:** Most 2023-2024 flagships from major brands
**Challenging:** Budget phones with basic cameras

If your phone can shoot 240fps slow-motion (check your camera settings), you'll get quality similar to iPhone. Many Samsung Galaxy phones can shoot at 960fps, which is actually superior.

### Check Slow-Mo Settings

Before blaming an app:
1. Open your camera app
2. Switch to slow-motion mode
3. Look for FPS settings (120, 240, 480, 960)
4. Use at least 240fps for swing analysis

Many golfers use their Android's slow-mo at 120fps, which is too choppy for proper analysis.

### Storage Space

High-frame-rate videos eat storage fast. A 10-second swing at 240fps can be 100MB+. Make sure you have space, or the app will fail to save recordings.

## How We Tested

We recorded the same swing with each app on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra:
- Outdoor range, natural lighting
- 240fps slow-motion mode
- Face-on and down-the-line angles
- Same 12-handicap golfer

We evaluated:
- **Speed:** How fast do you get feedback?
- **Accuracy:** Do suggestions match what a pro would say?
- **Usability:** Is the interface intuitive?
- **Value:** Worth it for the average golfer?
- **Android stability:** Crashes, bugs, device compatibility

---

## What Android Apps Are Missing (iOS-Only)

Some popular options don't have Android versions:

- **Sportsbox AI** ($780/yr) - 3D biomechanics, iOS-only
- **Mustard Golf** ($150/yr) - Drill recommendations, iOS-only
- **OnForm** ($50/yr) - Lesson platform, iOS-only

If you need these specific features, iOS has an edge. But for most golfers, the Android options are more than sufficient.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which Android phones work best for golf swing analysis?

Samsung Galaxy S-series and Google Pixel are the best-supported. Any flagship from 2022+ will work well. Mid-range phones work but may have slower processing.

### Do I need a tripod?

Depends on the app. Swing Analyzer, V1 Golf, and 18Birdies work fine propped up or handheld. SWEE AI really needs a tripod for best results. See our guide on [recording your swing without a tripod](/blog/phone-golf-swing-video/) for practical tips.

### Why do some apps only work on iPhone?

Apple's standardized hardware makes AI development easier. Android has thousands of device variations, so some developers skip it. The apps that do support Android well have invested in cross-platform compatibility.

### Can I use the default camera app?

Yes! Your phone's slow-mo camera works fine for self-review. But you won't get AI analysis, drawing tools, or structured feedback. Apps add value on top of hardware.

### Will these apps drain my battery?

Yes - video processing is intensive. Expect 15-20% battery use per hour of active recording and analysis. Bring a charger to the range.
