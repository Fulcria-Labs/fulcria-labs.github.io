## Mustard Golf: The Swing Analysis Specialist

Mustard Golf, developed in partnership with Golf Digest, focuses entirely on one thing: helping you understand and improve your swing.

### What Mustard Does Well

**AI-Powered Swing Analysis**: Mustard uses "sensorless motion-capture" technology to analyze your swing from regular phone video. The app places virtual markers on your body and breaks down your movement patterns.

**Personalized Improvement Plans**: After analysis, Mustard creates a customized lesson plan based on your specific swing faults. The app prioritizes your areas for improvement and provides scores on swing path and body movements.

**Professional Instruction**: The app includes video lessons from Mark Blackburn, one of Golf Digest's top-ranked instructors. These aren't generic tips—they're tied to your specific swing analysis.

**Practice Anywhere**: Many of Mustard's drills work at home. You don't need a range or course to work on your [tempo](/golf/instruction/2026/02/13/golf-swing-tempo.html) or [body rotation](/golf/instruction/2026/02/12/golf-hip-rotation.html).

**Justin Rose Connection**: Developed with input from former world #1 Justin Rose, giving the analysis framework tour-level credibility.

### Where Mustard Falls Short

**No Short Game**: The app focuses exclusively on the full swing. If you want to work on your [chipping](/golf/short-game/2026/02/26/chipping-made-simple.html) or [putting](/golf/short-game/2026/02/25/putting-fundamentals.html), look elsewhere.

**No Input for Specific Issues**: You can't tell the app "I slice everything" and have it focus there. It analyzes what it sees without context for your ball flight.

**Missing Fundamentals**: Grip, posture, and [alignment](/golf/fundamentals/2026/02/22/golf-alignment-aim.html) aren't part of the analysis model—surprising omissions since they're foundational to any good swing.

## 18Birdies: The On-Course Companion

18Birdies started as a GPS app and evolved into a comprehensive on-course tool. It's designed to help you during rounds, not between them.

### What 18Birdies Does Well

**GPS Accuracy**: Coverage of 43,000+ courses worldwide with distances to greens, hazards, and layup targets. The GPS is reliable and works with Apple Watch/Wear OS.

**Strokes Gained Analysis**: Premium members can track every shot and see where they're gaining or losing strokes compared to other golfers at various skill levels. Understanding your [actual weaknesses](/golf/analysis/2026/02/10/golf-divot-pattern.html) beats guessing.

**Stat Tracking**: Record scores, fairways hit, greens in regulation, and putts. Over time, you build a clear picture of your game.

**Tee Shot Planner**: Uses aggregate data from golfers at your skill level to recommend where to aim off the tee. Data-driven course management.

**Free Tier Value**: The free version includes GPS, scoring, stats, and even side games (skins, wolf, dots). You can use 18Birdies effectively without paying.

**Social Features**: Connect with friends, run tournaments with live leaderboards, and track rounds together.

### Where 18Birdies Falls Short

**Swing Analysis Is Basic**: The premium tier includes an "AI Swing Analyzer," but it's not the app's core strength. For serious swing work, dedicated analysis apps go deeper.

**Premium Required for Best Features**: Strokes Gained, club recommendations, and the Tee Shot Planner all require the $99.99/year subscription.

**Practice Gap**: 18Birdies shines on the course but offers little for practice sessions at home or the range.

## Price Breakdown

### Mustard Golf
- **Free**: Upload videos, see your top swing fault and overall swing score
- **Premium Monthly**: $24.99/month
- **Premium Annual**: $149.99/year (50% discount)

### 18Birdies
- **Free**: GPS, scoring, stats, side games, community
- **Premium Weekly**: $7.99/week
- **Premium Monthly**: $19.99/month
- **Premium Annual**: $99.99/year

**Value Analysis**: If you only care about on-course GPS and tracking, 18Birdies free tier delivers tremendous value. If you want deep swing analysis, Mustard's premium is competitive at $150/year given the AI technology involved.

## Which App Is Actually Right for You?

### Choose Mustard Golf If:

- **You want to improve your swing** between rounds
- **You practice more than you play** (or want to start practicing more)
- **You prefer structured lessons** with professional instruction
- **You're working on specific swing mechanics** like [weight transfer](/golf/instruction/2026/02/14/golf-weight-transfer.html) or [club face control](/golf/technique/2026/03/01/club-face-control.html)
- **You're comfortable self-coaching** based on AI feedback

### Choose 18Birdies If:

- **You play frequently** and want to track rounds
- **You need GPS distances** on unfamiliar courses
- **You want to understand your game through data** (Strokes Gained)
- **You enjoy playing with friends** and want leaderboards/side games
- **You want a free option** that still delivers core value

### Why Not Both?

Here's the truth: these apps complement each other perfectly. Use Mustard Golf for practice sessions to work on your swing. Use 18Birdies on course to track rounds and understand where to focus that practice.

The combination of Mustard's $150/year plus 18Birdies' free tier gives you:
- Deep swing analysis and improvement plans
- Professional instruction content
- GPS for 43,000+ courses
- Score and stat tracking
- Social features and side games

That's comprehensive coverage for less than the cost of two or three private lessons.

## How Both Compare to Swing Analyzer

At [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com), we believe you shouldn't need to commit to monthly subscriptions or lengthy analysis sessions just to improve. Our approach:

- **90-second analysis** instead of waiting minutes for results
- **Fun grading system** that makes practice enjoyable
- **Handicap guessing** to benchmark your swing
- **No tripod required** for recording

If you want quick feedback during range sessions without the commitment of annual subscriptions, try Swing Analyzer as an alternative or complement to these apps.

## Bottom Line

**Mustard Golf** wins for dedicated practice and swing improvement. The Golf Digest partnership and tour-level instruction content justify the premium price for serious improvers.

**18Birdies** wins for on-course play. The free tier alone beats most competitors, and premium features like Strokes Gained provide genuine insight into your game.

For most golfers, the question isn't "which one?"—it's recognizing that practicing your swing and tracking your rounds serve different purposes. Pick the tool that matches what you're actually trying to accomplish.
