Real golf courses aren't flat. You'll face uphill lies, downhill lies, balls above your feet, and balls below your feet. Each requires specific adjustments to hit solid shots.

Here's your complete guide to conquering uneven terrain.

## The Universal Rules

Before we get into specifics, here are principles that apply to every uneven lie:

1. **Widen your stance** for better balance
2. **Make a shorter, controlled swing** - don't try to overpower it
3. **Take practice swings on the slope** to feel where the club contacts the ground
4. **Expect reduced distance** and club up or down accordingly
5. **Prioritize solid contact** over power

Now let's break down each lie type.

## Uphill Lies

When your lead foot is higher than your trail foot (for right-handers, left foot above right).

### What Happens

The slope effectively adds loft to your club. Your 7-iron becomes more like an 8 or 9-iron. The ball will fly higher and shorter than normal.

### How to Adjust

| Adjustment | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| **Body angle** | Tilt your body to match the slope - shoulders and hips parallel to the ground |
| **Weight** | Accept that more weight will be on your back foot |
| **Ball position** | Play it slightly back in stance |
| **Club selection** | Take 1-2 more clubs (7-iron instead of 8-iron) |
| **Aim** | Aim right of target - the ball will draw/hook left |

### The Key Thought

Swing with the slope, not against it. Let the slope help you launch the ball. Don't fight to keep your weight forward.

## Downhill Lies

When your trail foot is higher than your lead foot. This is the harder of the two for most golfers.

### What Happens

The slope takes loft off your club. Your 7-iron becomes more like a 5 or 6-iron. The ball will fly lower and run more after landing.

### How to Adjust

| Adjustment | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| **Body angle** | Lead shoulder lower, matching the slope |
| **Weight** | About 60% on your front foot |
| **Ball position** | Play it back in stance |
| **Club selection** | Take more loft (9-iron instead of 7-iron) |
| **Aim** | Aim left of target - the ball will fade/slice right |

### The Key Thought

Chase the ball down the slope. Extend your arms down the hill through impact. Fighting the slope leads to fat shots or topped balls.

## Ball Above Feet

When the ball is higher than your feet - you're standing below the ball on the slope.

### What Happens

The lie angle becomes flatter. The ball will draw or hook left for right-handed golfers.

### How to Adjust

| Adjustment | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| **Grip** | Choke down on the club - the ball is closer to you |
| **Stance** | Stand more upright than normal |
| **Swing path** | Make a flatter, more around-the-body swing |
| **Aim** | Aim right of target - expect the ball to curve left |

### The Key Thought

The slope wants to hook the ball. Work with it, not against it. Aim right and let the curve happen.

## Ball Below Feet

When the ball is lower than your feet - you're standing above the ball on the slope. This is often considered the most challenging lie.

### What Happens

The lie angle becomes more upright. The ball will fade or slice right for right-handed golfers.

### How to Adjust

| Adjustment | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| **Grip** | Use the full length of the club |
| **Stance** | Bend your knees significantly - sit into your stance |
| **Balance** | Widen stance considerably for stability |
| **Aim** | Aim left of target - expect the ball to curve right |

### The Key Thought

Maintain your knee flex through the entire swing. Standing up is the most common error and leads to topped shots or thin contact.

## Combination Lies

On real courses, you'll often face combinations - like a downhill lie with the ball below your feet. In these cases:

1. Apply adjustments from both categories
2. Emphasize the more severe slope
3. Take an extra club for safety
4. Accept that you're hitting a recovery shot, not attacking the pin

## Practice Drill: The Slope Circuit

Find a sloped area on the practice range or course and hit 5 balls from each lie type in sequence:

1. Uphill lie
2. Downhill lie
3. Ball above feet
4. Ball below feet

Notice how each affects your contact and ball flight. Build a mental library of what to expect.

## Common Mistakes on Uneven Lies

### 1. Not Adjusting Club Selection

The slope changes your effective loft. If you don't adjust your club, you'll consistently miss short or long.

### 2. Ignoring the Ball Flight Tendency

Every uneven lie pushes the ball in a predictable direction. Aim for it instead of fighting it.

### 3. Making a Full Swing

Uneven lies require balance. A three-quarter swing with solid contact beats a full swing with poor contact every time.

### 4. Poor Practice Swing Location

Take your practice swing from the actual slope, not from flat ground next to the ball. Feel where the club hits the ground.

## Analyze Your Uneven Lie Technique

Use [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) to record practice shots from uneven lies. Compare your body angles and balance to shots from flat lies to see if you're making the necessary adjustments.

## Summary

| Lie Type | Ball Flight | Aim | Club Adjustment |
|----------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| Uphill | Higher, shorter | Right | More club |
| Downhill | Lower, longer | Left | More loft |
| Ball above feet | Hooks left | Right | Choke down |
| Ball below feet | Slices right | Left | Full length |

Master these adjustments and you'll save 2-3 strokes per round just by handling terrain better than your playing partners.
