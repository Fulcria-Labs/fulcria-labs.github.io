You line up a 35-footer, give it a confident roll, and watch it slide six feet past the hole. Now you are staring at a downhill slider for par. You miss that one too. Three putts, one bogey, and the sinking feeling that you just gave away a stroke you did not have to lose.

Sound familiar? You are not alone. The average golfer with a handicap above 15 three-putts more than three times per round. That is three free strokes handed back to the course every time you play.

Here is the thing most golfers get wrong: **three-putting is almost never a stroke problem. It is a distance control problem.** More than 80 percent of three-putts happen because the first putt finishes too far from the hole, not because you misread the line. You left yourself a five-footer instead of a two-footer, and that second putt suddenly has teeth.

The fix is not complicated, but it does require deliberate practice. These seven drills will recalibrate your feel for distance and make three-putting a rare event instead of a recurring frustration.

## Why Distance Control Matters More Than Line

Before we get into the drills, it is worth understanding why speed beats direction for scoring.

Your dispersion pattern on any putt is longer front-to-back than it is left-to-right. On a 30-foot putt, a typical amateur's distance scatter might be eight feet long but only three feet wide. That means your speed error is almost always bigger than your aim error.

Fix the speed, and the three-putts disappear. Even if your read is slightly off, a putt that finishes 18 inches past the hole is still a tap-in. A putt that finishes five feet past is a coin flip.

For a full breakdown of how to combine speed with better reads, check out our [guide to reading greens](/blog/how-to-read-greens-golf/).

## Drill 1: The Ladder

This is the most popular distance control drill in golf for good reason. It forces your brain to make constant micro-adjustments.

**Setup:** Place five tees or coins in a straight line at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 feet from your starting spot. Use a flat section of the practice green if possible.

**Execution:** Putt one ball to each distance, working from shortest to longest. Your goal is to stop each ball within three feet of its marker. Then work back down from 50 to 10 feet.

**Why it works:** The ladder drill trains your brain to scale stroke length to distance in real time. You cannot fall into a groove because every putt demands a different feel. After ten minutes of this, your internal speedometer is much more finely tuned.

## Drill 2: Eyes Closed

This one feels strange at first, but it is remarkably effective.

**Setup:** Drop three balls at 20 feet from the hole. Read the putt and take your setup as usual.

**Execution:** Take two practice strokes with your eyes open, looking at the hole. Then close your eyes and hit the putt. Do not open them until the ball has stopped rolling. Repeat from 30 and 40 feet.

**Why it works:** When you remove visual input, your body relies on feel and proprioception to judge distance. This is the same internal calibration system you use when you toss a ball underhand to someone across a room. You do not aim precisely; you feel the distance. Closing your eyes strengthens that feel, and it transfers directly to on-course putting.

## Drill 3: The Gate Lag

This drill builds the habit of getting the ball past the hole without blasting it.

**Setup:** Place two tees 18 inches behind the hole, about a putter-head width apart, creating a gate.

**Execution:** From 25, 35, and 45 feet, putt three balls at each distance. Every putt must reach the hole but stop before passing through the gate. A putt that stops short of the hole is a miss. A putt that rolls through the gate is also a miss.

**Why it works:** Tour pros know that the ideal speed for a lag putt is one that would roll 12 to 18 inches past the hole if it missed. This drill ingrains that window. You learn to give the ball enough speed to hold its line without creating a stressful comebacker.

## Drill 4: Fringe to Fringe

This is the simplest drill on the list and one of the best for developing raw touch.

**Setup:** None. Just find an open section of the practice green.

**Execution:** Stand on one fringe and putt a ball to the opposite fringe. Your goal is to stop it on the fringe without rolling off the green. Then putt it back. Keep going back and forth, varying your targets.

**Why it works:** Long putts are where three-putts live, and most golfers rarely practice putts longer than 20 feet. This drill forces you to hit 40, 50, even 60-foot putts while developing the feel for when to apply more or less energy. The fringe acts as a natural boundary that gives you instant feedback.

## Drill 5: The One-Hand Roll

This is less of a putting drill and more of a feel drill, but it translates beautifully to the green.

**Setup:** Stand 30 feet from the hole with a ball in your dominant hand.

**Execution:** Roll the ball underhand toward the hole, trying to stop it within three feet. Do this five times, then pick up your putter and hit five putts from the same distance.

**Why it works:** Your hand already knows how to judge distance. You have been throwing and rolling things your entire life. When you roll a ball underhand before putting, you activate the same motor-control pathways that judge speed and distance. Many tour players do a version of this during practice rounds. It reminds your nervous system that putting is not a mechanical puzzle. It is a feel-based skill, just like tossing a ball to a friend.

## Drill 6: The Clock Face

This drill combines distance control with green reading under light pressure.

**Setup:** Place four balls around the hole at equal spacing, forming a clock face at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions, all at 25 feet.

**Execution:** Putt each ball in sequence. Your goal is to two-putt all four. Each putt will have different break and slope, so you have to read the green and manage speed for four very different looks. Track how many of the four you two-putt. Repeat until you can go four-for-four consistently.

**Why it works:** On the course, you never get the same putt twice. This drill simulates that reality by forcing you to adjust your read and speed for every ball. It also creates a mild competitive pressure when you are three-for-three and need to close it out.

## Drill 7: The Scoring Zone Ladder

This is a finishing drill that bridges distance control with scoring confidence.

**Setup:** Place tees at 3, 4, 5, and 6 feet from the hole.

**Execution:** Make two putts in a row from 3 feet before moving to 4 feet. Make two in a row from 4 before moving to 5, and so on. If you miss, go back to 3 feet and start over.

**Why it works:** Even with great lag putting, you will occasionally leave yourself a 4 or 5-footer. This drill makes sure those putts do not become three-putts. The consecutive-makes requirement adds real pressure, simulating the feeling of standing over a must-make second putt on the course.

## How These Drills Fit Into Your Practice

You do not need to do all seven drills every time you visit the practice green. Pick two or three and spend 20 minutes. Here is a simple rotation that covers everything:

**Session A (lag focus):** Ladder Drill + Fringe to Fringe + Gate Lag

**Session B (feel focus):** Eyes Closed + One-Hand Roll + Clock Face

**Session C (scoring focus):** Ladder Drill + Scoring Zone Ladder + Clock Face

Three sessions per week with this rotation will noticeably reduce your three-putt count within a few rounds. Most golfers see improvement in as few as two to three practice sessions because distance control is largely a feel skill, not a mechanical one.

## Build a Putting Routine You Trust

Drills sharpen your feel, but you also need a consistent process on the course. A simple putting pre-shot routine helps you transfer practice confidence to real putts.

Our guide on [building a pre-shot routine](/blog/golf-pre-shot-routine/) covers how to create one that works under pressure. The short version: read the putt, take two practice strokes calibrated to the distance, set up, and go. No extra looks. No second-guessing.

For the mechanical foundations of a repeatable stroke, our [putting fundamentals guide](/blog/putting-fundamentals/) covers grip, alignment, and tempo in detail.

## The Bigger Picture: Where Putting Fits in Your Scoring

Eliminating three-putts is one of the fastest ways to drop strokes, but it is just one piece of the scoring puzzle. If you are working on breaking 100, 90, or 80, putting improvements compound with better approach play and course management.

A golfer who stops three-putting three times per round instantly saves three strokes. That alone can be the difference between a 95 and a 92, or an 85 and an 82. For a deeper look at what each scoring milestone requires, check out our guides on [how to break 100](/blog/how-to-break-100-golf/), [how to break 90](/blog/how-to-break-90-golf/), and [how to break 80](/blog/how-to-break-80-golf/).

And while putting happens on the green, the strokes you save there are often set up by better approach shots. If you are leaving yourself 40-foot putts because your iron play is inconsistent, working on your full swing mechanics will naturally reduce your lag putting challenge. Tools like [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) can help pinpoint what is going wrong in your full swing so that more approach shots finish closer to the pin, giving your improved distance control even less work to do.

## Start This Week

Here is your action plan:

1. **Next practice session:** Spend 15 minutes on the Ladder Drill and Fringe to Fringe. That is it. Just get your feel dialed in.
2. **Next round:** Before you play, hit ten lag putts from 30 feet or more on the practice green. Pay attention to distance, not line.
3. **Track your three-putts.** Write the number on your scorecard after each round. Watching that number drop is the motivation that keeps you practicing.

Three-putting is the most fixable scoring leak in golf. You do not need a new putter, a lesson, or a mechanical overhaul. You just need to spend a little time teaching your hands what your eyes already know: how far away the hole is.
