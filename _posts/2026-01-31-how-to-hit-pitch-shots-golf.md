The pitch shot sits in that critical zone between a full wedge and a simple chip. It's the shot you face 10-15 times per round, typically from 20-80 yards. Get good at it, and your scoring improves immediately. Struggle with it, and you'll waste strokes on holes where par should be routine.

Most amateurs approach pitch shots with inconsistency and anxiety. The distance feels awkward—too far for a chip, too close for a full swing. The result is tentative contact, poor distance control, and frustration.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know: setup fundamentals, swing mechanics, club selection, distance control, and practice drills that build real skill.

## Pitch Shot vs Chip Shot: Understanding the Difference

Before we dive into technique, let's clarify what makes a pitch shot different from a chip.

**Chip shots** are low trajectory shots that spend minimal time in the air and roll most of the way to the hole. Think of them as extended putts played with a lofted club.

**Pitch shots** are higher trajectory shots where the ball flies most of the distance and rolls minimally after landing. They're designed to carry obstacles and stop quickly on the green.

The simple rule: chip shots roll more than they fly, pitch shots fly more than they roll.

### When to Use a Pitch Shot

You should reach for a pitch shot when:

**Over obstacles**: There's a bunker, rough, or water between you and the green that you need to carry.

**Tight pin positions**: The flag is cut close to your side of the green with little room to work with. You need the ball to land and stop quickly.

**From the rough**: When the ball is sitting down in longer grass 30-60 yards from the green, a pitch shot with a wedge gets the ball airborne cleanly.

**Uphill or elevated greens**: You need extra height to reach a green that sits above you.

**When the ball needs to stop**: A green running away from you or firm conditions where roll-out would be disastrous.

For situations where you have plenty of green to work with and no obstacles, a [chip shot](/blog/chipping-made-simple/) is the higher percentage play. The general principle: chip when you can, pitch when you must.

## Setup Fundamentals for the Perfect Pitch Shot

Great pitch shots start before you swing. The setup pre-programs the correct strike pattern and ball flight.

### Stance Width

Your stance should be narrower than a full swing but wider than a chip. A good reference is roughly hip-width apart, though you can go slightly narrower for shorter pitches and wider for longer ones.

The narrower stance centers your head over the ball and reduces lower body rotation, which is exactly what you want for a controlled pitch.

### Weight Distribution

This is critical: set approximately 60% of your weight on your lead side and keep it there throughout the swing.

Forward weight creates the descending strike that produces crisp contact and consistent trajectory. Many amateurs hang back on their trail foot trying to "help the ball up," which leads to fat and thin contact.

The loft of your wedge gets the ball airborne. Your job is to hit down through it.

### Ball Position

For a standard pitch shot, position the ball slightly forward of center—roughly aligned with your sternum or just inside your lead heel.

This position allows the club to bottom out just after the ball, creating the ball-first contact you need. Too far back produces low runners. Too far forward risks thin contact.

### Posture and Alignment

Maintain slight knee flex with a natural forward tilt from your hips. Your spine angle should be similar to a full swing, just with a narrower base.

Align your feet, hips, and shoulders parallel to your target line. Some players prefer opening their stance slightly (feet left of target for right-handers) to clear their hips through impact, but this is optional. Start square and adjust based on what feels natural.

### Hand Position

At address, your hands should be slightly ahead of the ball—not dramatically forward like a chip, but definitely not behind. This forward press helps promote the descending strike.

Feel like the shaft leans slightly toward the target. This de-lofts the club a degree or two but ensures solid contact.

## Club Selection for Pitch Shots

Pitch shots are played with your wedges: pitching wedge, gap wedge (typically 52 degrees), sand wedge (56 degrees), and lob wedge (60 degrees).

### Understanding Your Options

**Pitching Wedge (44-48 degrees)**: Best for longer pitches (60-80 yards) where you need a flatter trajectory and more roll-out.

**Gap Wedge (50-52 degrees)**: The versatile mid-range option for 40-60 yard pitches with moderate height and controlled spin.

**Sand Wedge (54-56 degrees)**: Your go-to for most pitch shots from 30-50 yards when you need the ball to stop reasonably quickly.

**Lob Wedge (58-60 degrees)**: Reserved for short pitches over obstacles or tight pins where maximum height and minimal roll are required.

The higher the loft, the higher the flight and quicker the stop. But higher loft also means more difficulty making solid contact and less forgiveness for errors.

### The Smart Selection Strategy

When you have a choice between clubs, default to less loft. A pitching wedge hit with good tempo is more consistent than a lob wedge requiring perfect execution.

As you gain confidence and [distance control with your wedges](/blog/wedge-distance-control-guide/), you'll develop specific yardages for each club and swing length. Until then, let trajectory needs dictate club selection.

## The Pitch Shot Swing Technique

The pitch swing blends elements of both the full swing and the chip. It's a miniature version of your regular motion with some key adjustments.

### The Takeaway

Start the club back smoothly with your arms, shoulders, and chest moving together. There's no need for a big turn—your shoulders might rotate 45 degrees compared to 90 degrees in a full swing.

Keep the takeaway low and wide for the first foot or so. This creates the sweeping motion that produces clean contact from various lies.

### Wrist Hinge

Here's where pitch shots differ significantly from chips. While chipping requires minimal wrist action, pitching demands a natural hinge.

As the club reaches hip height in your backswing, allow your wrists to hinge naturally. This creates the leverage needed to generate clubhead speed without forcing it.

The amount of hinge depends on distance—more for longer pitches, less for short ones. But some hinge is essential. Without it, you'll struggle to create the speed needed to reach your target.

### Backswing Length

For a standard 40-yard pitch, your hands might reach chest or shoulder height. For a 20-yard pitch, maybe hip to waist high.

The key is matching your backswing length to the distance you're facing. Too long a backswing forces you to decelerate. Too short requires excessive acceleration and introduces inconsistency.

### Downswing and Impact

This is where the magic happens. Your lower body leads the downswing with a slight shift toward the target, then rotation.

But unlike a full swing where you really drive with your hips, the pitch shot uses a more controlled lower body action. Think of it as a "quiet" hip turn that clears space for your arms to swing through.

Your arms drop the club down on plane while maintaining the wrist hinge you created going back. As you approach impact, the club naturally releases—the shaft unbends and the clubface squares up.

Critical point: you're not actively flipping or scooping. The release happens as a result of acceleration, not manipulation.

### Contact and Strike

At impact, your hands should be slightly ahead of the ball with the shaft leaning toward the target. This creates the descending blow that compresses the ball against the turf.

You'll take a small divot after the ball. Not a massive trench, but a thin strip of grass that starts at the ball and extends forward. This confirms you hit down and through rather than scooping up.

### Follow Through

Accelerate through impact to a balanced finish. For shorter pitches, your finish might be waist-high. For longer ones, closer to shoulder height.

The key: your follow-through should always be longer than your backswing. This ensures acceleration through the ball.

If you find yourself with a long backswing and abbreviated follow-through, you're decelerating—the death of solid pitch shots.

## Distance Control: The Art of Wedge Play

Hitting solid pitch shots is step one. Controlling distance precisely is step two and what separates decent wedge players from great ones.

### The Three-Length System

The simplest approach to distance control uses three distinct swing lengths for each wedge:

**Short pitch** (hands to waist on backswing): Your baseline distance. For a 56-degree wedge, this might be 30 yards.

**Medium pitch** (hands to chest): Roughly 50% more distance. Same wedge might go 45 yards.

**Full pitch** (hands to shoulder): Maximum distance for that club, perhaps 60 yards with the 56-degree.

Practice these three swings until you know your exact yardages. Write them down. Reference them until they become automatic.

### The Clock Method

Another popular system uses clock positions to control distance. Imagine your arms as clock hands:

- **9 o'clock**: Hands at hip height
- **10 o'clock**: Hands at chest height
- **11 o'clock**: Hands at shoulder height

For each wedge, each position produces a specific yardage. The structure helps you make consistent swings under pressure.

### Tempo Over Force

Here's a principle many amateurs miss: distance comes from swing length, not swing speed.

Make the same smooth tempo swing regardless of distance. Need to hit it farther? Lengthen your backswing. Need it shorter? Shorten your backswing.

Don't try to muscle short pitches or slow down long ones. Consistent tempo with variable length is the formula.

A 2:1 ratio works well—take two beats going back, one beat coming through. This rhythm promotes acceleration while preventing the rushed, jabby motion that destroys consistency.

### Grip Down for Fine-Tuning

When you're between distances, choking down on the grip is your friend. Gripping down one inch typically reduces distance 5-8 yards.

This gives you micro-adjustments without changing your swing. A 50-yard pitch becomes 45 yards simply by sliding your hands down the grip.

## Common Pitch Shot Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: Decelerating Through Impact

**The problem**: Fear of hitting it too far causes you to slow down at the ball. Result: fat shots, thin contact, and terrible distance control.

**The fix**: Shorten your backswing and commit to accelerating through. It's better to fly a pitch 10 feet past the hole than chunk it halfway.

Phil Mickelson's advice applies here: "When you decelerate, the leading edge comes up and you blade it."

### Mistake 2: Scooping to Help the Ball Up

**The problem**: Trying to "lift" the ball into the air by flipping your wrists and falling back onto your trail foot.

**The fix**: Trust the loft. Keep your weight forward, hands ahead, and hit down through the ball. The club's loft creates height, not your manipulation.

If you're hitting fat shots consistently, check your weight distribution. You're likely hanging back.

### Mistake 3: Too Much or Too Little Wrist Hinge

**The problem**: Overly active wrists create inconsistent contact and control. Locked wrists produce weak, short shots.

**The fix**: Natural hinge. As the club swings back, let your wrists hinge organically—don't force it, don't prevent it. Think of how your wrists move when tossing a ball underhand. That's the feeling you want.

### Mistake 4: Wrong Club Selection

**The problem**: Using a lob wedge when a gap wedge would work better, or vice versa.

**The fix**: When in doubt, take less loft. A pitching wedge with good tempo is more forgiving than a lob wedge requiring perfect contact. Save the high-lofted wedges for shots that truly demand them.

### Mistake 5: Poor Grip Pressure

**The problem**: Death-gripping the club out of anxiety, creating tension that restricts your swing.

**The fix**: [Light grip pressure](/blog/golf-grip-pressure-guide/)—maybe 4 or 5 on a 10-point scale. Soft hands create feel and allow the club to release naturally. Tension kills touch.

### Mistake 6: No Landing Spot

**The problem**: Aiming vaguely at "the green" without a specific landing target.

**The fix**: Pick a spot the size of a dinner plate where you want the ball to land. Your brain is incredible at calibrating force when given a specific target. "Somewhere on the green" is too vague.

## Practice Drills for Pitch Shot Mastery

### Drill 1: The Ladder Drill

**Setup**: Mark zones at 20, 30, 40, and 50 yards using alignment sticks, towels, or cones.

**Execution**: Using one wedge, hit pitch shots to each zone in sequence. Start at 20, work to 50, then back down to 20.

**Goal**: Land 3 consecutive shots in each zone before moving to the next.

**Purpose**: This builds distance awareness and control with a single club. It teaches you to vary swing length while maintaining tempo.

### Drill 2: The Landing Zone Challenge

**Setup**: Place a towel or hula hoop on the practice green at 30 yards.

**Execution**: Hit 10 pitch shots trying to land each ball on the target.

**Goal**: Track your success rate. Tour pros land 70%+ inside 10 feet from 50 yards. Aim for steady improvement.

**Purpose**: Trains precision landing rather than vague "get it close" targets. This is where real scoring improvement comes from.

### Drill 3: Clock Position Calibration

**Setup**: Pick one wedge (start with 56-degree).

**Execution**: Hit 5 balls each at 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, and 11 o'clock backswing positions. Mark where they land.

**Goal**: Know your exact yardages for each position.

**Purpose**: Creates your personal yardage chart. Once you know these numbers, you can confidently select the right swing for any distance.

### Drill 4: Trajectory Control

**Setup**: Place a range basket or alignment stick 10 yards in front of you at waist height.

**Execution**: Hit pitch shots that clear the obstacle and land on the green.

**Goal**: Consistent height with various distances.

**Purpose**: Simulates real course situations where you need to carry obstacles. Also builds confidence that you can get the ball up when needed.

### Drill 5: One Ball to Each Distance

**Setup**: Drop 9 balls at random spots from 20-80 yards around the practice green.

**Execution**: Hit each ball once—no do-overs. Track how many you get inside 15 feet.

**Goal**: 5 out of 9 inside 15 feet is solid. 7 out of 9 is excellent.

**Purpose**: Simulates on-course pressure where you get one chance. This is "transfer practice"—what you do here translates directly to better scores.

### Drill 6: Quiet Lower Body

**Setup**: Practice pitches with your feet together or touching.

**Execution**: Hit 20 pitch shots to various distances without losing balance.

**Goal**: Solid contact and reasonable distance control.

**Purpose**: Exaggerates the "quiet lower body" feeling pitch shots require. When you go back to normal stance width, you'll feel much more stable and controlled.

## Mental Approach to Pitch Shots

### Commit to Your Decision

Indecision kills pitch shots. Once you've selected your club and swing length, commit completely. A decent plan executed with confidence beats a perfect plan executed tentatively.

### Visualize the Flight

Before each pitch, see the entire shot in your mind: the ball launching, climbing to its peak, descending to your landing spot, bouncing once or twice, and releasing toward the hole.

The more detailed your visualization, the better your body will execute the shot automatically.

### Trust Your Practice

You've hit thousands of pitch shots on the range. Trust that muscle memory on the course. Overthinking mechanics during the swing is a disaster. Feel the motion, see the target, and let it go.

### Accept Imperfection

Even tour pros don't stick every pitch inside 5 feet. Sometimes you'll catch it thin and fly the green. Sometimes you'll hit it fat and come up short. That's golf.

The goal isn't perfection—it's consistency and steady improvement. Track your progress: "Last month I got 40% of my pitches inside 15 feet. This month it's 50%." That's winning.

## How to Practice Pitch Shots at Home

Don't have time for the practice green? You can build feel and mechanics at home.

### Backyard Chipping Net

Hit pitch shots into a chipping net in your yard. Focus on tempo, strike quality, and wrist hinge. You won't get distance feedback, but you'll groove the motion.

### Indoor Rehearsal

Practice your pitch swing indoors without a ball. Focus on proper sequence: smooth takeaway, natural hinge, quiet lower body, accelerating through.

Do 20 rehearsal swings daily. Your brain doesn't distinguish much between real swings and quality practice swings—you're building neural pathways either way.

### Video Analysis

Record your pitch shots from face-on and down-the-line angles. Compare your positions to tour pros. Look for:

- Ball position consistency
- Weight distribution at setup
- Wrist hinge amount
- Follow-through length relative to backswing

[Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) provides instant feedback on your wedge technique in just 90 seconds—no tripod required. It's like having a coach in your pocket, identifying issues you can't feel.

## On-Course Strategy with Pitch Shots

### Know Your Numbers

Before the round, remind yourself of your three key distances with each wedge. When you face a 45-yard shot, you instantly know: "That's my 10 o'clock sand wedge."

This eliminates guesswork and builds confidence.

### Factor in Conditions

Your 50-yard pitch might fly only 45 yards into a stiff wind. Or 55 yards downwind. Adjust club selection, not your swing.

Firm greens require less swing because the ball will release more. Soft greens let you be more aggressive knowing the ball will check.

### Plan Your Misses

From 40 yards, short-sided to a bunker with the pin 10 feet on, the smart play might be to aim at the center of the green 25 feet past the hole. Now your miss zone is safe.

This is [smart course management](/blog/golf-course-management-strategy/)—understanding when to be aggressive and when to play the percentages.

### When to Use the Flop Shot Instead

Sometimes the situation demands a [flop shot](/blog/how-to-hit-flop-shot-golf/) rather than a standard pitch. If you're short-sided over a bunker with almost no green to work with, the flop's extra height and quick stop might be necessary.

But remember: the flop is higher risk. Use it only when a standard pitch won't get the job done.

## From Practice to Lower Scores

Pitch shots are the bridge between approach shots and the green. Master this distance range, and you'll:

- Get up and down more consistently
- Convert birdie opportunities on par 5s
- Scramble for par when you miss greens
- Lower your handicap without changing your full swing

The technique isn't complicated. The setup is straightforward. What it requires is deliberate practice with specific goals and feedback.

Spend 30% of your short game practice time on pitching (the other 70% split between chipping and putting). Track your results. Celebrate improvement.
