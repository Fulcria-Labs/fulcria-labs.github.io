![How Often Should You Take Golf Lessons?](/assets/images/golf-lesson-frequency.png)
Golf lessons aren't cheap. At $75-150+ per hour with a qualified instructor, most recreational golfers can't afford weekly sessions. So what's the optimal frequency?

The answer depends on your goals, your practice habits, and where you are in your golf journey.

## The Beginner: More Lessons, Closer Together

If you're new to golf, consider lessons every 1-2 weeks for the first month or two. Here's why:

Bad habits form fast. Without correction, you'll ingrain swing flaws that become harder to fix later. Early intervention prevents years of frustration.

**Recommended:** 4-6 lessons in your first 2 months, then reassess.

## The Intermediate: Strategic Lessons

Once you have the basics, you need time to practice between lessons. Taking a lesson every 3-4 weeks gives you time to:

- Process what you learned
- Practice the drills
- Identify what's working and what's not
- Come back with specific questions

**The danger:** Going too long between lessons lets bad habits creep back in. But too frequent lessons overwhelm you with information.

**Recommended:** Once monthly, or every 3-4 weeks during the season.

## The Serious Golfer: Periodic Tune-Ups

Single-digit handicappers often don't need frequent instruction. Their swing is fundamentally sound. What they need is:

- Periodic check-ins (quarterly or seasonally)
- Help when something feels off
- Course strategy and mental game work

**Recommended:** 3-4 lessons per year, plus additional sessions if something breaks down.

## The Lesson/Practice Ratio

Here's the often-ignored truth: **lessons without practice are wasted money.**

A good rule of thumb is 3-4 hours of focused practice for every hour of instruction. If you can't practice between lessons, space them further apart.

Taking lessons back-to-back without practice time is like reading textbooks but never doing homework. The information doesn't stick.

## Making Lessons Stick

### Before the lesson:

- Have a specific goal or question
- Warm up so you're not hitting cold shots with the pro watching

### During the lesson:

- Ask for 1-2 drills to practice
- Take video of the drills being demonstrated
- Ask what success looks like

### After the lesson:

- Practice within 48 hours while the feeling is fresh (see our [practice routine guide](/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/03/golf-practice-routine.html))
- Use video to verify you're doing the drills correctly
- Track what works and what doesn't

## Between Lessons: Technology Helps

Modern AI swing analyzers extend the value of lessons by:

- Providing feedback during practice sessions
- Helping you know if you're doing the drill correctly
- Identifying when old habits creep back
- Giving you data to bring to your next lesson

Think of AI analysis as the practice partner between professional sessions.

**The bottom line:** Most golfers should take 6-12 lessons per year, depending on goals. But the lesson itself is just 10% of improvement. The other 90% is what you do between sessions.
