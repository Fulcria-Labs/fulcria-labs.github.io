The release is where speed becomes distance. It's the moment your body's rotation transfers to the clubhead, creating the whip that sends the ball flying. Get it right, and you tap into effortless power. Get it wrong, and you're working hard for mediocre results.

But here's what most golfers don't understand: the release isn't something you do. It's something that happens—when everything before it is correct.

## What Is the Golf Release?

The release is the point where your wrist angles unhinge and the clubhead accelerates past your hands through impact. It's often misunderstood as "rolling the hands over" or "flipping the wrists." Neither is correct.

A proper release involves:

- **Wrist extension**: The lead wrist moves from flexed (bowed) through impact to extended after the ball
- **Natural rotation**: The clubface rotates from slightly open to square at impact to closed post-impact
- **Speed transfer**: Energy built in the backswing and downswing transfers to the clubhead

The key insight: the release should feel like a consequence of your swing, not an action you force.

## The Release Sequence Explained

Understanding the timing helps you stop manipulating and start trusting the swing:

### Pre-Impact (The Store)

Coming into impact, your wrists are still cocked, storing energy. The lead wrist is flexed (bowed), keeping the clubface square to slightly closed. Your hands are ahead of the ball.

This is the "lag" you hear instructors obsess over. It's not something you hold artificially—it's preserved by rotating your body correctly.

### At Impact (The Transfer)

At the moment of contact, several things happen simultaneously:

- Lead wrist is still slightly flexed or flat
- Shaft leans forward (hands ahead of clubhead)
- Hips are open 30-45 degrees
- Shoulders are approaching square
- Weight has shifted to the lead foot

The ball compresses against the face. This is where contact quality is determined.

### Post-Impact (The Release)

This is where "release" actually happens:

- The lead wrist moves from flexed to extended
- The clubhead accelerates past the hands
- The trail arm straightens
- Forearms rotate naturally
- The clubface rotates closed (relative to target)

By the time your arms reach waist height post-impact, the release is complete. The clubhead is accelerating away from you.

## Three Types of Release Patterns

Not every great player releases the club the same way. Your release pattern should match your swing style and tendencies:

### 1. The Roll Release

**Best for**: Players who swing down with an open face and tend to hit weak fades or slices.

In this pattern, the trail hand rolls over the lead hand through the impact zone. The forearms rotate more aggressively, closing the face faster.

**Feel**: Like the back of your lead hand points at the ground shortly after impact.

This is what traditional instruction called "turning it over." It works for players who naturally hold the face open too long.

### 2. The Hold Release

**Best for**: High-speed players who hook or hit the ball too high and left.

Used by Dustin Johnson and Viktor Hovland, this pattern keeps the trail arm bent longer through impact. The face stays slightly open longer, counteracting excessive rotation.

**Feel**: Like your arms stay closer together through the ball, with less forearm rotation.

This isn't about manipulating the face—it's about matching release to swing speed and path.

### 3. The Push Release

**Best for**: Players seeking consistency and less timing dependency.

The most "neutral" release. The wrists aren't actively rotating—they're responding to centrifugal force and body rotation. Works especially well with stronger grips.

**Feel**: Like you're throwing the clubhead at the target with your body, not your hands.

Modern instruction trends toward this pattern because it relies less on precise timing.

## Common Release Mistakes

These errors cost distance and accuracy:

### Casting (Early Release)

Releasing the angle between your arms and club too early in the downswing. The clubhead "throws" outward before impact, losing speed and creating a steep, scooping motion.

**Signs**: Hitting behind the ball (fat shots), high weak shots, no divot or divot before ball.

**Fix**: Focus on keeping your back to the target longer in the transition. The release should happen because of rotation, not arm action.

### Flipping (Breakdown)

The lead wrist bends backward (cups) through impact instead of staying flat or bowed. The clubhead passes the hands before contact.

**Signs**: Thin shots, inconsistent contact, no forward shaft lean at impact.

**Fix**: Feel like you're driving the handle toward the target through impact. The clubhead follows—it doesn't lead.

### Holding Off

Over-controlling the face through impact, preventing natural rotation. Creates weak, blocked shots that start right and stay right.

**Signs**: Shots that push right without curving, feeling like you're "steering" the club.

**Fix**: Trust the swing. Let the clubface rotate naturally through the ball. A slightly closed face post-impact is normal.

### Over-Rotation

The opposite problem—rolling the hands too aggressively, closing the face too fast. Creates hooks and pulled shots.

**Signs**: Low pulls, snap hooks, shots that start left and go further left.

**Fix**: Feel like your body rotation leads the hands. When the body stops and the hands take over, you get over-rotation.

## The Connection to Earlier Swing Positions

Here's what most instruction misses: release problems are usually caused by earlier mistakes.

- **Bad takeaway** → compensate at release
- **Steep backswing** → cast to shallow it out
- **No hip rotation** → flip to square the face
- **Reverse weight shift** → can't rotate through properly

This is why isolated release drills often fail. You're treating the symptom while the cause remains in your setup or backswing.

## Drills to Improve Your Release

These drills train the feeling of proper release:

### The Frisbee Drill

Mimic throwing a frisbee with your lead arm. Notice how your arm extends naturally and the wrist releases at the end. That motion—extension and rotation as a consequence of throwing—is exactly what the golf release should feel like.

Do this without a club first. Then take practice swings trying to recreate that feeling.

### The Pump Drill

Start at the top of your backswing. Pump down to waist height, then return to the top. Repeat 2-3 times. On the final pump, swing through.

This grooves the proper sequence: body leads, arms follow, hands release last. You can't pump correctly while casting.

### The Split-Hand Drill

Grip the club with your hands 2-3 inches apart. Make half swings. The separation forces you to feel the proper release—your hands can't work against each other.

If you flip, the gap makes it obvious. If you release properly, you'll feel extension and rotation happening naturally.

### The Tee Drill

Place a tee in the ground 6-12 inches in front of your ball position. Make practice swings focused on releasing through that tee, not at the ball.

This encourages extension through the shot rather than releasing at the ball (which causes flipping).

### The Slow-Motion Drill

Make full swings at 25% speed. Feel each position: lag entering impact, flat wrist at contact, extension and rotation post-impact.

Slow motion ingrains proper sequencing that carries over to full speed.

## Feel vs. Real

A critical concept for release: what you feel isn't what's real.

Players trying to "hold lag" often flip through impact—the feel of holding creates overcompensation. Players trying to "release the club" often cast—feeling the release makes them do it too early.

This is why recording your swing reveals the truth. Your [downswing sequence](/2026/02/27/golf-downswing-sequence.html) and [impact position](/2026/02/28/golf-impact-position.html) are either correct or they're not. Feeling isn't evidence.

When working on release, record yourself. See what's actually happening. Then match the feels to the reality.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Release is a result, not an action** - Proper release happens automatically when sequencing is correct
2. **Match your release to your swing** - Roll, hold, or push—find what works for your natural tendencies
3. **Fix the cause, not the symptom** - Most release problems start earlier in the swing
4. **Use drills that train sequencing** - Pumps, slow motion, and split hands build proper patterns
5. **Verify with video** - Feel lies; recording reveals what's really happening

The release is where all your swing work pays off. Build it correctly, and you'll hit shots that feel effortless but travel forever. Force it, and you'll work harder for less.
