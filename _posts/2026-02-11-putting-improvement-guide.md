# Putting Improvement: The Complete Guide to Lower Scores

You can save more strokes on the putting green than anywhere else on the course. Tour pros average around 29 putts per round—amateurs average 36 or more. That's seven strokes just on the greens. Here's how to close that gap.

## Why Putting Matters Most

Consider this math: On a par 72, putting accounts for roughly half your strokes if you're hitting greens in regulation. But unlike the full swing, putting doesn't require strength, flexibility, or athleticism. It rewards practice and technique.

The good news? Unlike fixing a slice or adding clubhead speed, putting improvement can happen fast. Most amateurs have never practiced putting with purpose—they just roll a few before a round and hope for the best.

## The Two Pillars of Great Putting

Every putt comes down to two factors:

1. **Line** - Where you're aiming
2. **Speed** - How hard you're hitting it

Master these, and you'll make more putts. It really is that simple. Most three-putts happen because of speed, not line. Most missed short putts happen because of line, not speed.

## Building a Solid Putting Stroke

### Grip: Comfort Over Convention

There's no single correct putting grip. Reverse overlap, cross-handed, claw, arm-lock—they all work. The key is:

- Quiet hands through the stroke
- Consistent grip pressure (light but controlled)
- Palms facing each other (neutralizes wrist action)

Whatever grip you choose, keep pressure constant. Tightening during the stroke is a major yips trigger.

### Setup: The Foundation

Your putting setup should feel stable and balanced:

- **Eyes over the ball** (or just inside the target line)
- **Shoulder-width stance** (or narrower for feel)
- **Ball position** forward of center in your stance
- **Weight slightly favoring** your lead foot
- **Arms hanging naturally** from shoulders

The putter shaft should be nearly vertical at address. Excessive forward press or hands too far back creates inconsistency.

### The Stroke: Pendulum Motion

Think of your arms and shoulders as a triangle. That triangle rocks—it doesn't break apart. The stroke is a pendulum motion controlled by the shoulders:

1. **Back**: Shoulders rock, taking the putter straight back
2. **Through**: Shoulders rock, putter accelerates through impact
3. **Follow-through**: Putter finishes toward target, same length as backswing

Your wrists should stay quiet. Any hinge creates variability. Some pros use slight wrist action for feel, but for amateurs, the shoulder-controlled stroke is more reliable.

## Speed Control: The Most Important Skill

Here's a truth tour players know: You can miss your line by a bit and still make putts. Miss your speed badly, and you three-putt.

### The 17-Inch Rule

Your goal on every putt should be to roll it 17 inches past the hole if it misses. Research shows this gives the ball the best chance to fall in while avoiding disastrous distance errors.

- Too short: Never had a chance
- Way past: Three-putt territory
- 17 inches by: Perfect capture speed

### Lag Putting Drill (The Gate Drill)

1. Place four tees in a square about 4 feet wide
2. Take 10 paces back (roughly 30 feet)
3. Putt toward the square—goal is landing inside
4. Make 10 in a row before moving on

This drill builds distance control. Most amateurs have terrible speed control from 30+ feet because they never practice it.

### The Pace Ladder

Another great speed control drill:

1. Drop balls at 10, 20, 30, 40 feet
2. Putt each to the same target
3. Focus on consistent tempo—same rhythm regardless of distance

Your backswing length controls distance, not swing speed. A longer backswing for longer putts, same tempo always.

## Green Reading: The Overlooked Skill

You can stroke the ball perfectly and miss if you've misread the green. Here's how to read greens better:

### The Walk-Around Method

1. **Start behind the ball**, looking toward the hole
2. **Walk to the hole**, feeling the slope under your feet
3. **Look from behind the hole** back toward your ball
4. **Crouch low** to see the overall terrain

Water drains somewhere. Look for the lowest point of the green—break tends toward drainage.

### Break More, Not Less

Amateurs consistently underread break. When in doubt, play more break than you think. The common miss is low-side (below the hole), where the putt never had a chance to fall in.

"Never up, never in" applies to break too—if you don't give the ball enough room to break, it can't fall in.

### Grain Awareness

Grass grows toward water and toward the setting sun. This affects both speed and break:

- **Putting into the grain**: Slower, break less
- **Putting with the grain**: Faster, break more
- **Cross-grain**: Break increases in the direction the grass leans

Check the cup edge—shaggy side shows where the grain is growing toward.

## Proven Putting Drills

### The Gate Drill (Accuracy)

Set two tees just wider than your putter head, one inch in front of the ball:

1. Stroke the ball through the gate
2. If you hit the tees, your path is off
3. Repeat until you can make 10 clean strokes

This trains a straight-back, straight-through stroke for short putts.

### The 3-Foot Circle Drill

Place four tees in a circle, 3 feet around a hole:

1. Make a putt from each tee
2. Go around the circle making 12 consecutive putts
3. If you miss, start over

Three-footers should be automatic. This drill builds that confidence and exposes any directional weakness in your stroke.

### The Clock Drill

Place balls at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock around the hole at 3 feet:

1. Make all four putts
2. Move back to 4 feet and repeat
3. Continue to 6, 8, 10 feet
4. If you miss, start over from that distance

This builds confidence under pressure and reveals which break direction challenges you.

## Practice Routine: 20 Minutes to Better Putting

Don't have hours to practice? This focused routine works:

**Minutes 1-5: Speed Control**
- Lag putt from 40 feet, focus on stopping within 3 feet
- Five balls, repeat until consistent

**Minutes 6-12: Mid-Range (8-15 feet)**
- Scatter balls around the green
- Read each putt fully
- Track makes/misses mentally

**Minutes 13-18: Short Putts (3-5 feet)**
- Circle drill or gate drill
- Build confidence for the round ahead

**Minutes 19-20: Pressure Putting**
- Pick a 6-foot putt with break
- Must make 5 in a row before leaving
- Creates real stakes

## Technology for Putting Improvement

### What Launch Monitors Show

Putting-specific launch monitors like Capto or SAM PuttLab reveal:

- Face angle at impact
- Stroke path
- Impact location on the face
- Launch direction vs. target line

This data shows exactly what's causing misses—no guessing.

### AI Swing Analysis

Apps like [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) can analyze your putting stroke from video, identifying:

- Setup alignment issues
- Stroke path deviations
- Tempo inconsistencies
- Head movement

Objective feedback beats feel every time—what you think you're doing often isn't what's actually happening.

## Common Putting Mistakes (and Fixes)

### Problem: Looking Up Too Early
**Fix:** Keep your eyes on the spot where the ball was until you hear it drop

### Problem: Decelerating Through Impact
**Fix:** Practice making your follow-through equal to or longer than your backswing

### Problem: Hitting the Ball Instead of Stroking It
**Fix:** Think "swing through the ball" not "hit the ball"

### Problem: Reading Break After Lining Up
**Fix:** Make your read, commit to your line, then focus only on speed

### Problem: Changing Your Grip Pressure
**Fix:** Hold the putter just tight enough that it won't slip—maintain that pressure throughout

## The Mental Game of Putting

Putting is 90% mental once you have technique. Here's how to think on the greens:

### Commit to Your Read
Doubt kills putts. Once you've read the putt and picked your line, commit. A committed stroke on a wrong line beats a doubtful stroke on a right line.

### Focus on Process, Not Outcome
Your job is to start the ball on your intended line at your intended speed. Whether it goes in is partially out of your control (spike marks, wind, imperfect greens). Focus on execution.

### Same Routine Every Time
A consistent pre-putt routine anchors you. Two looks, one practice stroke, step in, go. Whatever your routine, make it automatic.

## The Bottom Line

Putting improvement is achievable for every golfer. You don't need athleticism, flexibility, or new equipment. You need:

1. A fundamentally sound stroke (shoulders control it)
2. Speed control practice (more important than accuracy)
3. Better green reading (play more break)
4. Focused practice (20 minutes beats hours of mindless rolling)

Cut your three-putts in half, and you'll drop strokes immediately. Master the 3-footers, and you'll play with confidence. Put real time into speed control, and long lag putts become two-putts instead of three.

Your putter is the most-used club in the bag. Practice it like it matters—because it does.
