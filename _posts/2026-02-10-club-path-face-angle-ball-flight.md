Every golf shot you hit is determined by two factors at impact: club path and face angle. Master these concepts and you unlock the ability to shape shots on command. Ignore them and you spend your rounds wondering why the ball curves the wrong way.

This is not complicated once you understand the basics. Let us break down exactly what these terms mean and how they work together to create every shot pattern you see on the course.

## What Is Club Path?

Club path describes the direction your clubhead travels through impact relative to your target line.

If you drew a line from the ball to your target, club path measures how much your swing diverges from that line. Path can be:

- **In-to-out**: The clubhead approaches from inside the target line and exits outside it
- **Out-to-in**: The clubhead approaches from outside the target line and exits inside it
- **Zero (neutral)**: The clubhead travels directly along the target line

When someone says they swing "over the top," they mean their path is out-to-in. When they say they swing "from the inside," they mean in-to-out.

Path alone does not determine where the ball goes. But it plays a critical role in curvature.

## What Is Face Angle?

Face angle is where the clubface points at impact, measured relative to the target line.

Like path, face angle has three possibilities:

- **Open**: Face points right of target (for right-handed golfers)
- **Closed**: Face points left of target
- **Square**: Face points directly at target

Here is the key insight that changes how most golfers think about ball flight: the face angle is the primary factor in determining starting direction. Your ball launches mostly where the face is pointing, not where the path is going.

Old ball flight laws taught that the ball starts on the path and curves based on face angle. Modern launch monitors proved this wrong. The ball starts about 75-85% toward face angle and only 15-25% toward path.

## How Path and Face Work Together

Now we combine these two factors. The relationship between path and face angle creates curvature.

When face angle and path point in the same direction, the ball flies straight. When they differ, the ball curves.

### The Simple Rule

If the face is open to the path, the ball curves right. If the face is closed to the path, the ball curves left.

Notice we said "open to the path," not "open to target." This distinction matters.

You can have a clubface that is closed to the target but open to your path. The result would be a ball that starts left but curves right. Understanding this relationship is how you diagnose and fix your miss patterns.

### Common Shot Patterns

**Straight shot**: Face and path are both aligned to target. The ball starts at the target and stays there.

**Push draw**: In-to-out path with face closed to path but slightly open to target. Ball starts right, curves left, ends at target. This is the stock shot of many tour professionals.

**Pull fade**: Out-to-in path with face open to path but slightly closed to target. Ball starts left, curves right, ends at target. Another playable shape when controlled.

**Slice**: Out-to-in path with face open to both path and target. Ball starts left of target, curves hard right, ends right of target. The most common amateur miss.

**Hook**: In-to-out path with face closed to both path and target. Ball starts right, curves hard left, ends left of target. Often the overcompensation for a slice.

**Push**: In-to-out path with face square to path. Ball starts right and stays right with minimal curve.

**Pull**: Out-to-in path with face square to path. Ball starts left and stays left with minimal curve.

## Why Most Amateurs Slice

Armed with this knowledge, we can diagnose the slice that plagues 80% of recreational golfers.

A slice requires two conditions: an out-to-in path and a face that is open to that path.

The typical amateur comes over the top with an out-to-in path of around 5-10 degrees. Their face might be 2 degrees closed to target. Sounds okay, right?

Wrong. Because the face is closed to target but still open to their path, the ball starts slightly left and then curves violently right. The more the face differs from the path, the more the ball curves.

The fix is not just to close the face more. That might reduce curve but starts the ball further left. The complete fix addresses both path and face relationship.

## How to Fix Your Path

If you swing over the top with an out-to-in path, here are practical adjustments:

**Check your alignment first.** Many golfers aim left to compensate for a slice, which steepens their out-to-in path and makes the problem worse.

**Feel like you swing to right field.** For a right-handed golfer, imagine hitting the ball toward the first base dugout instead of center field. This sensation helps shallow the path.

**Drop your hands straight down from the top.** The over-the-top move happens when the upper body fires first. Letting the hands drop passively before rotating creates space for an inside path.

**Put a headcover outside the ball.** Place it about six inches ahead and to the right. If you hit the headcover, your path is out-to-in. Train yourself to miss it.

## How to Control Face Angle

Face angle at impact comes from grip, wrist conditions, and forearm rotation.

**Strengthen your grip for a closed face.** Rotate both hands clockwise on the handle so you see more knuckles on your left hand at address. This pre-sets a closed face through impact.

**Weaken your grip for an open face.** Rotate hands counterclockwise to see fewer knuckles. The face stays more open through the hitting zone.

**Feel the toe passing the heel.** Through impact, the toe of the club should rotate past the heel. If your face stays open, you are likely holding off the release.

**Check shaft lean at impact.** Forward shaft lean with hands ahead of the ball naturally delofts and squares the face. Flipping adds loft and opens the face.

## Using Launch Monitor Data

Modern technology makes path and face visible. If you have access to a launch monitor like Trackman, FlightScope, or even a quality phone app, you can see exact numbers.

Key metrics to watch:

- **Club path**: Negative means out-to-in, positive means in-to-out
- **Face angle**: Negative means closed, positive means open
- **Face to path**: The relationship between these two that creates curve

When face to path is zero, the ball flies straight regardless of where path points. When face to path is positive, the ball curves right. Negative means left curve.

A 3 degree positive face to path creates noticeable fade spin. A 3 degree negative creates draw spin. Beyond 5 degrees, the curve becomes hard to control.

## Practice Drills

Here are three drills to groove proper path and face relationships:

### Gate Drill

Set two alignment sticks in the ground about a foot apart, just past the ball position. Practice swinging through the gate without hitting either stick. This trains a neutral path.

### Closed Stance Draws

Aim your body 20-30 degrees right of target but keep the clubface aimed at the target. Swing along your body line. The in-to-out path with face closed to path creates a draw.

### Open Stance Fades

Opposite of above. Aim body left, face at target. Swing along your body line. The out-to-in path with face open to path creates a fade.

These exaggerated setups help you feel the difference between path and face.

## Putting It Into Practice

Start with self-diagnosis. Where does your ball start? Where does it curve? Using the framework above, identify your path and face relationship.

Then pick one factor to change first. Most amateurs benefit from path work initially since the over-the-top move is so common. Once path improves, face control becomes easier.

Video analysis helps tremendously here. Record your swing from down the line and look at the club's approach into the ball. Is it coming from inside or outside the hands?

Better yet, use a swing analyzer that measures these factors directly. Real numbers beat guesswork every time.

## The Goal

Your goal is not necessarily to eliminate all curve. Many great players prefer to work the ball one direction or the other. The goal is to understand what creates your ball flight so you can repeat good patterns and fix bad ones.

When you know your path is 4 degrees in-to-out and your face is 1 degree closed, you know exactly what to expect: a slight draw. When conditions change or your timing is off, you can diagnose the problem immediately.

This is the difference between random golf and intentional golf. Path and face are the language of ball flight. Learn to speak it and the game becomes much simpler.
