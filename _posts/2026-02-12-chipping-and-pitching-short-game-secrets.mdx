Your short game is where scores are made or broken. You can stripe your driver 280 down the middle, but if you cannot get up and down from 30 yards, those pretty tee shots mean nothing on the scorecard.

Here is the reality: the average amateur loses 7-10 strokes per round inside 100 yards. That is not because they lack talent. It is because they have never learned the fundamentals that actually work.

This guide covers everything you need to know about chipping and pitching. Not complicated theory. Not tour-pro-only techniques. Just practical methods that will help you save strokes starting this weekend.

## Chipping vs Pitching: What is the Real Difference?

Before we get into technique, you need to understand when to use each shot. Getting this wrong is the first mistake most golfers make.

**Chipping** is a low shot that spends more time rolling than flying. Think of it as a putt with a little hop at the start. You use it when there is nothing between you and the hole except green.

**Pitching** is a higher shot that flies most of the way and stops quickly after landing. You use it when you need to carry something like a bunker, rough, or slope.

### The Golden Rule of Shot Selection

Chip whenever you can. Pitch only when you have to.

Why? A chip has a much larger margin for error. Even if you mis-hit it slightly, the ball stays low and usually ends up somewhere near the hole. A mis-hit pitch can fly the green, chunk into the rough, or blade across to the other side.

Ask yourself: "What is the minimum trajectory I need?" If you can bump it onto the green and let it roll, do that. Only add height when obstacles demand it.

## The Chip Shot: Keep It Simple and Roll It Close

The chip is your scoring weapon. Master this shot and you will save strokes every round.

### Step 1: Set Up for Success

Your setup pre-programs the shot. Get this right and the swing almost takes care of itself.

**Narrow your stance.** Your feet should be closer together than a full swing, roughly under your hips. This centers your head over the ball and limits unnecessary body movement.

**Weight forward.** Put 60-70% of your weight on your front foot before you swing. Once you are there, keep it there. This promotes the downward strike that makes clean contact.

**Ball position back.** Play the ball off your back foot or center of your stance, depending on how much roll you want. Back equals lower and more roll. Center equals slightly higher with moderate roll.

**Hands ahead.** At address, your hands should be slightly ahead of the ball. This delofts the club and helps you strike down on the ball.

### Step 2: Use Your Shoulders, Not Your Wrists

Here is the secret that transformed my chipping overnight: keep your wrists quiet.

Most amateurs use too much wrist action. They flip at the ball, trying to scoop it into the air. The result? Fat shots, thin shots, and zero consistency.

Instead, think of the chip as a big putting stroke. Your arms and shoulders move together. Your wrists stay firm. Create a lowercase "y" shape with your arms and the shaft, then maintain that shape throughout the motion.

Your body does the work, not your hands. Let your chest and hips guide the club back and through.

### Step 3: Pick Your Landing Spot

Before every chip, pick a specific landing spot on the green. Not "somewhere over there" but an exact point the size of a dinner plate.

Your brain is remarkably good at calibrating force when given a specific target. Give it one. Then visualize the ball landing on that spot and rolling to the hole.

### Step 4: Match Your Club to the Shot

You do not need your lob wedge for every chip. In fact, less loft is usually better.

**7-iron or 8-iron:** Use for bump-and-run shots when you have lots of green to work with. The ball pops up just enough to clear the fringe, then runs like a putt.

**Pitching wedge:** Your versatile middle-ground option. Some flight, some roll.

**Sand wedge:** When you need more height or less roll. Good for carrying a few feet of rough before the green.

Use the lowest-lofted club that gets the ball on the green. Then let it roll to the hole like a putt.

## The Pitch Shot: Height When You Need It

The pitch shot covers the tricky distances between a chip and a full wedge, typically 20-80 yards. When you need to carry an obstacle and stop the ball quickly, this is your shot.

### Step 1: Build a Solid Foundation

The pitch setup differs from the chip in important ways.

**Slightly wider stance.** Your feet should be about hip-width apart. Not as narrow as a chip, not as wide as a full swing.

**Weight still forward.** Keep 55-60% of your weight on your front foot. This creates the descending blow that produces crisp contact.

**Ball position center.** Play the ball in the middle of your stance or slightly forward. This allows the club to bottom out just after the ball.

**Light grip pressure.** Hold the club like you are holding a tube of toothpaste without squeezing any out. Tension kills touch.

### Step 2: Allow Natural Wrist Hinge

Here is where pitching differs from chipping. You need some wrist hinge to generate the clubhead speed for distance.

As the club reaches hip height in your backswing, let your wrists hinge naturally. Do not force it. Do not prevent it. Just let it happen like you are tossing a ball underhand.

The amount of hinge depends on distance. More for longer pitches. Less for short ones.

### Step 3: Match Backswing Length to Distance

Distance control comes from swing length, not swing speed.

For a 30-yard pitch, your hands might reach waist height. For 50 yards, chest height. For 70 yards, shoulder height.

The tempo stays the same. Smooth and rhythmic. The only thing that changes is how far back you take it.

Here is a critical point: your follow-through should always be longer than your backswing. If you take it back to chest height, finish at shoulder height. This ensures you are accelerating through impact.

Deceleration is the death of good pitch shots.

### Step 4: Commit and Accelerate

The biggest mistake I see with pitch shots is the fear of going too far. Golfers take the club back too far, then slow down through impact.

The result? Fat shots. Thin shots. Shots that finish halfway to the target.

Make this your mantra: "Short backswing, accelerate through." A smaller backswing with committed acceleration beats a long backswing with a tentative finish every time.

## Practice Drills That Build Real Skill

Reading about short game is one thing. Building the feel takes practice. Here are three drills that work.

### Drill 1: The Hula Hoop Challenge

This drill builds distance control for both chips and pitches.

**Setup:** Place a hula hoop or towel on the practice green. Set up balls at 10, 20, 30, and 40 yards.

**Execution:** Start with the closest ball. Chip or pitch it to land inside the target. If it lands inside, move to the next distance. Miss? Go back to the start.

**Goal:** Work through all four distances without missing. This builds the pressure you face on the course.

### Drill 2: The One-Hand Release

This drill grooves the proper release for pitch shots.

**Setup:** Take your normal address position but remove your lead hand. Place it on your thigh.

**Execution:** Using only your trail hand, make short pitch swings. Feel gravity drop the club naturally onto the ball. No forcing. No flipping.

**Goal:** Consistent ball-first contact with a natural release. When you add your lead hand back, you will feel how the club should move through impact.

### Drill 3: Par 18 Around the Green

This is competitive practice that simulates on-course pressure.

**Setup:** Pick nine different spots around the practice green at various distances and angles.

**Execution:** From each spot, chip or pitch and putt out. Par is 2 for each hole, so par for nine is 18.

**Goal:** Try to shoot par or better. Track your score over time to measure improvement.

This drill combines short game with putting, exactly like you face on the course. It also adds stakes that make your practice transfer to real rounds.

## Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### Mistake 1: Looking Up Too Soon

You want to see where the ball goes. Understandable. But lifting your head before contact changes your spine angle and leads to thin contact.

**The fix:** Keep your eyes on the spot where the ball was until after impact. Let your ears tell you where the ball went. Alternatively, pick a specific dimple on the ball and watch yourself hit that dimple.

### Mistake 2: Wrong Ball Position

Ball too far forward leads to thin contact. Ball too far back leads to chunked shots or shots that never get airborne.

**The fix:** For chips, start with the ball just back of center. For pitches, center or slightly forward. Adjust based on results. Video your setup to check your position.

### Mistake 3: Too Much Wrist on Chips

Flipping your wrists adds inconsistency and makes distance control nearly impossible.

**The fix:** Press an alignment stick against your lead forearm and grip. If the stick loses contact during your swing, your wrists are breaking down. Practice until you can maintain that connection.

### Mistake 4: Decelerating on Pitches

Fear of going long causes you to slow down at impact. This is the most destructive mistake in pitching.

**The fix:** Commit to a shorter backswing and accelerate through. Finishing past the ball is non-negotiable. If you are flying the green, make your backswing shorter. Never slow down to control distance.

### Mistake 5: Using the Wrong Club

Reaching for your 60-degree lob wedge when a pitching wedge would work better is a recipe for inconsistency. Higher loft requires more precision.

**The fix:** Default to less loft. Use the minimum trajectory needed to reach the green. Save the lob wedge for situations that truly demand it.

## Building Your Short Game Routine

Improvement requires focused practice. Here is a weekly plan that works.

**Monday and Wednesday:** 20 minutes of chipping. Focus on the bump-and-run with your 8-iron or pitching wedge. Work on landing spot precision with the hula hoop drill.

**Tuesday and Thursday:** 20 minutes of pitching. Practice the three distances (30, 45, 60 yards) with your gap wedge. Focus on consistent tempo and acceleration.

**Saturday:** Play Par 18. This tests both skills under simulated pressure.

**Sunday:** Free practice. Work on whatever felt weakest during your round.

Consistency beats intensity. Twenty minutes five days per week produces better results than two hours once a week.

## Short Game and Your Full Swing Connection

Your short game and full swing share common fundamentals. The [weight transfer](/blog/golf-weight-transfer-guide/) you use in chipping is a simplified version of what happens in your driver swing. The [tempo](/blog/golf-swing-tempo-guide/) that makes pitches consistent is the same rhythm that smooths out your irons.

Working on your short game often improves your full swing as a side effect. You develop better feel, softer hands, and improved awareness of where the clubhead is in space.

## Putting It All Together

The short game is not glamorous. Nobody posts Instagram videos of a well-executed bump-and-run. But it is where scoring happens.

Focus on these principles:

1. **Chip when you can, pitch when you must.** Use the minimum trajectory required.
2. **Keep wrists quiet for chips.** Think big putting stroke.
3. **Allow natural hinge for pitches.** But never flip or scoop.
4. **Match backswing length to distance.** Tempo stays constant.
5. **Always accelerate through impact.** Especially on pitches.
6. **Pick a specific landing spot.** Give your brain a target.
7. **Practice with purpose.** Drills that simulate on-course conditions.

Master these fundamentals and you will start saving strokes immediately. The scrambling percentage that felt impossible becomes routine. The up-and-down from the fringe becomes expected.

That is where confidence comes from. Not from hitting one perfect shot, but from knowing you have the skills to get up and down when you miss greens.
