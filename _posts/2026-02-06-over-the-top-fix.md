The over-the-top swing is the most common fault in amateur golf. It causes slices, pulls, weak contact, and endless frustration. Understanding why it happens is the key to fixing it.

Here's what's actually going on - and how to change it.

## What "Over the Top" Actually Means

In a good golf swing, the club drops slightly to the inside during the transition from backswing to downswing. This creates an "inside-out" swing path that produces solid contact and controlled ball flight.

When you come "over the top," the club moves outward instead - your hands and club swing out toward the ball from outside the target line. The club approaches the ball on a steep, outside-in path.

**The result:** Slices (if the face is open), pulls (if the face is square), or those weak, glancing contacts that go nowhere.

## Why Most Golfers Come Over the Top

Here's the frustrating truth: coming over the top often happens because you're trying to hit the ball too hard.

When you swing hard, the natural instinct is to throw the club at the ball with your arms and shoulders. This "casting" motion sends the club outward. The harder you try, the worse it gets.

**Common causes include:**

1. **Rushing the transition** - Starting down before you've completed the backswing
2. **Upper body dominance** - Using arms and shoulders instead of hips and core
3. **Poor sequencing** - Moving body parts in the wrong order
4. **Ball focus** - Thinking about hitting AT the ball instead of through it
5. **Tension** - Gripping too tight creates jerky, uncontrolled movements

## Why Quick Fixes Don't Work

You've probably tried these:

- "Drop your hands at the top"
- "Swing from the inside"
- "Feel like you're swinging to right field"

These tips don't work because they address symptoms, not causes. Your brain will always revert to the over-the-top pattern under pressure because it's trying to do what feels "powerful."

The real fix requires changing your sequencing and tempo - teaching your body a new pattern that feels natural under pressure.

## The 3 Drills That Actually Work

### Drill 1: The Pause Drill (30 seconds per swing)

Make your normal backswing, then pause at the top for a full 2 seconds. This breaks the rushing habit and gives your lower body time to initiate the downswing properly.

After the pause, start down by rotating your hips toward the target - NOT by pulling your arms down. Your arms should feel like they're "along for the ride."

**Why it works:** Forces proper sequencing. Hip rotation creates room for the arms to drop inside naturally.

### Drill 2: The Pump Drill (3-5 minutes)

Make your backswing, then bring the club halfway down and back up to the top. Do this "pump" 2-3 times before actually swinging through.

Each pump should start with your lower body, not your arms. Feel the club dropping slightly behind you during each pump.

**Why it works:** Programs the feeling of starting down with the lower body. Creates muscle memory for the proper transition.

### Drill 3: The Right Pocket Drill (for right-handed golfers)

Imagine you have a string attached from the butt end of the club to your right pants pocket. On the downswing, feel like that string is pulling the club toward your pocket before it releases toward the ball.

This exaggerated feeling of the club dropping "behind" you counteracts the over-the-top tendency.

**Why it works:** Creates the sensation of shallowing the club without thinking about swing path directly.

## The Tempo Connection

Fast backswings almost always lead to over-the-top moves. Your body can't complete proper sequencing if you're rushing.

Try this: Count "1-2-3" during your backswing and "4" at impact. Most amateurs are at "2" by impact. Slow down your takeaway and give yourself time to complete the pattern.

## What to Expect

Fixing an over-the-top swing takes time. You've probably been doing it for years - or decades. The new pattern will feel strange at first, maybe even weak.

Here's the timeline:

- **Week 1-2:** The new moves feel awkward and exaggerated
- **Week 3-4:** You start making better contact in practice
- **Month 2:** The new pattern becomes more natural
- **Month 3+:** You can trust it under pressure

The key is patience. Practice the drills in slow motion until they feel natural, then gradually add speed.

## Using Video to Check Your Progress

The over-the-top move is obvious on video:

1. Record your swing from behind (down the target line)
2. Watch the club at the start of the downswing
3. If it moves outward (toward the ball) first, you're over the top
4. If it drops slightly inward (behind you) first, you're on track

Check your video every practice session. Your feel and reality are often very different.

## The Bottom Line

Coming over the top isn't a mystery or a curse. It's a sequencing problem that happens when you try to power the swing with your upper body.

The fix is simple (not easy): Learn to start down with your hips, give the club time to drop, and stop rushing. The drills above will help - but only if you practice them consistently.

Give it 30 days of focused work. The results will speak for themselves.
