# 15 Golf Practice Drills That Actually Work

Most golfers practice wrong. They show up at the range, dump a bucket of balls, and hit driver after driver without any real purpose. An hour later, they leave having grooved the same bad habits they came with.

Effective practice is deliberate, focused, and uncomfortable. These 15 drills will challenge you, expose weaknesses, and build real skill that transfers to the course.

## Full Swing Drills

### 1. The 9-Shot Drill

This is the ultimate ball flight control exercise. Hit 9 shots with the same club: high fade, regular fade, low fade, high straight, regular straight, low straight, high draw, regular draw, low draw.

**How to do it:**
- Use a 7-iron
- Hit 3 of each shot shape
- Don't move to the next shape until you hit a successful one
- Track your success rate

Most golfers can't hit all 9 shots. That's the point. This drill reveals your natural shot shape and builds the feel for manipulating ball flight.

### 2. The Ladder Drill

Place targets at 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 yards. Hit one ball to each target in sequence. Go up the ladder, then back down.

**The catch:** You can't hit the next target until you're within 10 yards of the current one.

This builds distance control and exposes gaps in your yardage. You might discover you can't reliably hit 75 yards but are fine at 50 and 100.

### 3. The One-Club Challenge

Pick one club - usually a 7 or 8-iron - and play an imaginary 9 holes with only that club. Hit drives, approaches, chips, even putts. Vary your setup and swing length to produce different shots.

**Why it works:** Tour pros are incredibly creative with their clubs. This drill forces you to develop feel and shot-making rather than relying on having the "right" club.

### 4. The Alignment Station

Set up two alignment sticks - one for your feet, one along your target line. Hit 20 balls checking that your feet, hips, and shoulders are all parallel to your foot line.

After 20 balls, remove the sticks and hit 10 more. Check your alignment after each shot. You'll be shocked how quickly you drift offline without the visual aid.

### 5. The Slow Motion Drill

Make 5 swings in slow motion - taking a full 10 seconds from takeaway to finish. Feel every position: wrist hinge, shoulder turn, hip rotation, weight transfer.

Then hit 3 balls at full speed. The slow motion rehearsal ingrains proper positions that carry over to your real swing.

## Short Game Drills

### 6. The Circle Drill

Place 10 balls around a hole, all 3 feet away. The goal: make all 10. If you miss, start over.

**The pressure:** This simulates real putting pressure. When you're on ball 8 or 9, that 3-footer feels a lot longer. Master this and tap-ins become automatic.

### 7. The Gate Drill

Set up two tees just wider than your putter head, about 2 feet in front of your ball on the target line. Roll putts through the gate from increasing distances.

If you can't roll it through the gate, you can't start the ball on line. This drill exposes face angle issues at impact that you can't feel otherwise.

### 8. The Ladder Putting Drill

Pace off 10, 20, 30, and 40 feet from a hole. Hit one ball to each distance in sequence. The goal: leave each putt within a 3-foot circle of the hole.

Long putts are about pace control, not making putts. This drill calibrates your speed on a given green before you play.

### 9. The Par 18 Chipping Game

Drop 9 balls around the practice green in various lies. Chip each ball and putt out. Par is 18 (2 per hole). Keep score and try to beat it each session.

**Variations:**
- Play from difficult lies only
- Use only one club
- Play from bunkers mixed in

### 10. The Wedge Landing Spot Drill

Pick a specific landing spot for your chip. Place a towel on that spot. Hit 10 chips trying to land on the towel, watching how the ball releases from there.

Most amateurs focus on where the ball finishes. Better chippers focus on where it lands and how it releases. This drill builds that skill.

## Specialty Drills

### 11. The Worst Lie Drill

Find the worst lies on the range - bare ground, divots, thick rough, downhill slopes. Hit 10 shots from terrible lies.

**Why it matters:** On the course, you rarely get a perfect lie. Practice from bad lies builds confidence that you can advance the ball no matter what.

### 12. The First Tee Pressure Drill

Set up a specific shot - say a driver to a narrow window. Give yourself one chance to hit it. If you miss, you're "out of bounds" and you have to start your warm-up over.

This simulates the pressure of the first tee shot, which is often the hardest swing of the day.

### 13. The Course Simulation Drill

Instead of mindlessly hitting balls, "play" your home course on the range. Hit driver to the first fairway, then hit the approach you'd typically face. Mental rehearsal combined with physical practice builds course management skills.

### 14. The Eye-Closed Drill

Hit 5 chips or putts with your eyes closed. Focus on feel rather than mechanics. You might be surprised how well you hit it - or how badly.

**The insight:** If you hit it better with eyes closed, you're overthinking. If you hit it worse, you're relying too much on vision instead of proprioception.

### 15. The Competition Drill

Find a practice partner and compete. Closest to the pin, most putts made from 10 feet, first to hole out a chip. Any competitive format adds pressure that mirrors real golf.

You'll discover what happens to your game when something is on the line. This reveals tendencies you can work to correct.

## Building a Practice Routine

Don't try all 15 drills in one session. Pick 3-4 that address your weaknesses:

**Struggling with driving?** Focus on #3, #4, and #5
**Poor distance control?** Try #2 and #8
**Weak short game?** Work on #6, #9, and #10
**Can't perform under pressure?** Add #12 and #15

The best practice routine has:
- 10 minutes of putting drills
- 20 minutes of short game
- 20 minutes of full swing
- 10 minutes of simulated on-course scenarios

## Common Practice Mistakes to Avoid

**Hitting too many balls:** Quality over quantity. 50 focused shots beat 200 mindless ones.

**No target:** Every shot needs a specific target. Even range balls should have purpose.

**Ignoring short game:** 60% of your strokes are from 100 yards in. Practice accordingly.

**Perfect lies only:** The course doesn't offer flat lies on fresh range mats.

**No pressure:** Without stakes, practice doesn't transfer. Add competition or consequences.

## Track Your Progress

Keep a practice journal. Note which drills you did, your success rates, and insights gained. Over time, you'll see patterns that inform your practice and playing strategy.

Great golfers are made on the practice tee - but only when that practice is deliberate, challenging, and purposeful. Use these drills consistently and you'll see real improvement on the course.
