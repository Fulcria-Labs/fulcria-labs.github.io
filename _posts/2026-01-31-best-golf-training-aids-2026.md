## Best Training Aids to Fix a Slice

### 1. EyeLine Golf Speed Trap 4S

**Best Overall for Swing Path**

The Speed Trap has been a staple of instruction for years, and the new 4S version is the best yet. At half the size of the original, it now fits in your golf bag—making it practical for the range.

**How it works:** Adjustable rods create a "corridor" that forces you to swing on the correct path. Hit a rod, and you get instant feedback that you came over the top or too far from the inside.

**Why it works:** Visual and physical feedback is immediate. No guessing whether you're on plane.

**Best for:** Golfers who struggle with an outside-in swing path, chronic slicers, and over-the-top moves.

**Price:** ~$80-100

**Pairs with:** Our [fix your slice guide](/blog/fix-golf-slice/) and [downswing sequence](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/)

### 2. The Draw Board

**Best for Driver Slice**

The Draw Board is an elevated, wedge-shaped surface that promotes an inside-out swing path. Stand on it, tee up your driver, and the geometry naturally shallows your downswing.

**How it works:** The angled surface places you slightly further from the ball and tilted, which makes it nearly impossible to come over the top.

**Why it works:** Instead of thinking about swing mechanics, your body naturally adapts to the setup.

**Best for:** Driver-specific slice issues, golfers who "get it" with irons but slice the big stick.

**Price:** ~$150

### 3. Alignment Sticks (Budget Pick)

**Best Value for Path Work**

Two $15 fiberglass rods can do 90% of what expensive path trainers do. Lay one on the ground for target line, place another at an angle to represent your swing plane.

**How to use:** Place the angled stick just outside your ball. If you hit the stick on the downswing, you're coming over the top.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious golfers, those who want versatile practice tools.

**Price:** ~$15-20 for a pair

## Best Training Aids for Tempo and Timing

### 4. Lag Shot Golf Trainer

**Best Overall for Tempo**

The Lag Shot looks like a normal 7-iron but has a super-flexible shaft. This forces you to feel proper tempo and sequencing—rush it, and the clubhead lags behind awkwardly.

**How it works:** The whippy shaft exaggerates the feeling of "lag"—the trailing clubhead that creates power. You can't muscle it; smooth tempo is the only way.

**Why it works:** It builds motor patterns for proper sequence without thinking about it.

**Best for:** Golfers who rush the transition, "hitters" who need to become "swingers."

**Price:** ~$120-150

**Pairs with:** Our [tempo guide](/blog/golf-swing-tempo/) and [transition guide](/blog/golf-swing-transition-guide/)

### 5. Tour Striker Impact Sling

**Best for Ground Pressure**

This innovative tool teaches you to use ground force properly in the swing. It's essentially a resistance band attached to your club that forces proper sequencing.

**How it works:** The resistance creates feedback about when and how you're generating force. Improper sequence feels wrong immediately.

**Best for:** Players who spin out, early extend, or don't use the ground effectively.

**Price:** ~$100

### 6. Orange Whip

**Classic Tempo Trainer**

The Orange Whip has been around for years for good reason—it works. The weighted ball at the end and flexible shaft build tempo and balance.

**How it works:** The counterweight creates momentum you must control with rhythm, not muscle.

**Best for:** Warm-up routines, tempo development, off-season training.

**Price:** ~$110-130

## Best Training Aids for Connection

### 7. Tour Striker Smart Ball

**Best Overall for Arm/Body Connection**

This inflatable ball sits between your forearms and forces you to maintain proper connection throughout the swing. Used by Justin Rose, Darren Clarke, and coaches like Sean Foley.

**How it works:** If your arms disconnect from your body, the ball falls out. Simple, effective feedback.

**Why it works:** Eliminates the "chicken wing" finish and promotes synchronized rotation.

**Best for:** Golfers who flip at impact, break down through the ball, or have an inconsistent release.

**Price:** ~$30-40

**Pairs with:** Our [club face control guide](/blog/club-face-control/) and [chicken wing fix](/blog/fix-chicken-wing-golf/)

### 8. theHANGER

**Best for Clubface Awareness**

This clever device attaches to your club and rests against your forearm. If you flip or rotate the face open, you feel it immediately.

**How it works:** The arm contact provides constant feedback about face angle throughout the swing.

**Best for:** Players who struggle to "feel" face position, chronic slicers and hookers.

**Price:** ~$70-90

### 9. DIY Pool Noodle (Budget)

A cut pool noodle between your arms works similarly to the Smart Ball. Not as refined, but effective for $3.

## Best Tech-Driven Training Aids

### 10. HackMotion Wrist Sensor

**Best Tech Investment**

The HackMotion is the most sophisticated training aid for understanding wrist mechanics. It tracks flexion, extension, radial, and ulnar deviation in real-time with app-based feedback.

**How it works:** Straps to your lead wrist and measures exact angles at every point in your swing. The app provides audio cues and detailed analysis.

**Why it works:** Wrist position largely controls the clubface. Fix your wrists, fix your face.

**Best for:** Serious players willing to invest, data-driven golfers, those who want objective measurement.

**Price:** $295-$995 (depending on features)

**Pairs with:** Our [wrist hinge guide](/blog/golf-wrist-hinge-guide/)

### 11. Swing Analyzer Apps

Before investing in hardware, try app-based analysis. [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) provides AI-powered feedback on your swing in 90 seconds, using just your phone camera.

**How it works:** Record your swing, get instant feedback on positions, tempo, and key checkpoints.

**Best for:** Everyone—it's free to start and provides professional-level analysis without the cost.

**Price:** Free to try

## Best Training Aids for Impact

### 12. SKLZ Smash Bag

**Best Overall for Impact Feel**

The Smash Bag is exactly what it sounds like—a bag you hit at impact to feel proper position. The feedback is instant and physical.

**How it works:** Set up to the bag as if hitting a ball, then swing into it. The resistance reveals whether you're flipping, casting, or in proper impact position.

**Best for:** Feel learners, those who need physical feedback, [impact position](/blog/golf-impact-position/) work.

**Price:** ~$30-40

## How to Choose the Right Training Aid

### Match the Tool to Your Problem

1. **Slice?** → Speed Trap or Draw Board for path, theHANGER for face
2. **Inconsistent tempo?** → Lag Shot or Orange Whip
3. **Flip at impact?** → Smart Ball or Smash Bag
4. **Need data?** → HackMotion for wrists, Swing Analyzer app for video

### Consider Your Learning Style

- **Visual learners:** Video analysis (apps, launch monitors)
- **Feel learners:** Physical feedback tools (Smart Ball, Smash Bag)
- **Technical learners:** Data-driven aids (HackMotion, launch monitors)

### Start with the Basics

Before spending $300 on tech, master the fundamentals:
1. [Grip](/blog/golf-grip-guide/)
2. [Setup](/blog/golf-setup-stance/)
3. [Alignment](/blog/golf-alignment-aim/)

These three cost nothing to improve and affect everything else.

## Training Aids to Avoid

Not every training aid is worth your money:

- **Weighted donuts:** Can actually throw off timing
- **Most grip attachments:** Just practice proper grip instead
- **Anything promising "instant results":** Swing changes take reps

## The Bottom Line

The best training aid is the one you'll actually use. Expensive tech means nothing if it sits in your garage.

Our top recommendations:

- **Best Value:** Tour Striker Smart Ball ($35) + Alignment Sticks ($15) = $50 covers most needs
- **Best Slice Fix:** EyeLine Speed Trap 4S (~$90)
- **Best Tech:** HackMotion ($295+) for serious improvement
- **Best Free Option:** [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com) for AI video analysis

Whatever you choose, pair it with [purposeful practice](/blog/golf-practice-routine/). Training aids are tools, not magic wands.
