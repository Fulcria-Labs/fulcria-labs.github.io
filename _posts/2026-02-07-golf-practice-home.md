Bad weather. Limited time. No nearby range. The obstacles to practice are real.

But improvement doesn't require a course or driving range. Some of the most effective practice happens in your living room, backyard, or garage.

## Why Home Practice Works

Golf improvement comes from repetition of correct movements. At the range, you're focused on ball flight. At home, you can focus purely on mechanics.

Many tour pros do more swing work at home than at the range. The absence of a ball actually helps you feel the movement without worrying about the result.

## The 15-Minute Home Routine

### Minutes 1-3: Mirror Work

Stand in front of a full-length mirror or reflective window. Without a club, make slow-motion swings while watching:

- Posture at address
- Turn in backswing
- Hip movement in transition
- Extension through impact

The mirror provides instant feedback on positions.

### Minutes 4-7: Alignment Stick Drills

Place an alignment stick on the ground representing your target line. Practice:

- Taking the club back inside the stick
- Swinging down inside the stick
- Extending toward the target

Keeping the stick in your peripheral vision trains your body to swing on plane.

### Minutes 8-11: Slow Motion Swings

With a club but no ball, make swings at 25% speed. Focus on:

- Feeling weight transfer
- Keeping head steady
- Smooth transition from backswing to downswing

Slow motion builds the neural pathways that fast swings can't create.

### Minutes 12-15: Impact Bag or Pillow Drill

Hit into an impact bag (or firm pillow) focusing on:

- Leading with hands ahead of clubhead
- Hitting with the body, not just arms
- Proper position at impact

This builds the feel of compression without needing a ball.

## Indoor Equipment Worth Owning

| Equipment | Cost | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Putting mat | $30-50 | Putting is 40% of your score |
| Alignment sticks | $10 | Dozens of drill applications |
| Impact bag | $25-40 | Trains proper impact position |
| Foam practice balls | $10 | Hit partial shots safely |
| Weighted club | $30-50 | Builds strength and tempo |

**Total investment under $150 for a complete home practice setup.**

## The Backyard Option

If you have outdoor space, foam or limited-flight balls let you hit real shots safely. Even a 50-foot space is enough to work on:

- Chipping
- Pitch shots
- Punch shots
- Partial swings

The ball still launches and flies, giving you feedback on strike and direction without needing 200 yards of range.

## Tracking Home Practice

Film your home sessions just like you would at the range. The same swing issues exist whether there's a ball or not.

AI analyzers can evaluate practice swings too - they're measuring your movement, not ball flight. Upload a home session and get the same feedback you'd get at the range.

**The key:** Consistent 15-minute daily practice beats sporadic 2-hour range sessions. Build the habit, and improvement follows.
