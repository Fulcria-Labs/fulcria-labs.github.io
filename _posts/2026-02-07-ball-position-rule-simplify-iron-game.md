Here's a question: before your last round, how many times did you second-guess your ball position? Was the 7-iron supposed to be center? Slightly forward? Did you move it and then wonder if you moved it too much?

Ball position confusion creates hesitation. Hesitation kills good swings before they start.

What if you could eliminate that mental math entirely?

## The Problem With "Different Positions for Different Clubs"

You've probably seen the classic ball position chart. Driver off the front heel. Wedges in the middle. Irons somewhere in between, gradually shifting based on which club you're holding.

In theory, it makes sense. In practice, it creates chaos.

Most amateur golfers lack consistency in their ball placement. On the course, under pressure, you're not measuring ball widths or calculating exact positions. You're guessing. And every guess introduces a variable that can ruin your contact.

Here's what happens with the "sliding scale" approach:

- **Overthinking at address** - You're doing geometry instead of swinging freely
- **Inconsistent low point** - Your swing never learns where to bottom out
- **Difficulty diagnosing problems** - Was that chunk caused by your swing or your setup?
- **Practice that doesn't transfer** - Range sessions don't build muscle memory when positions vary

## The One Position Rule

What if you played every iron from the same spot?

This isn't a radical idea. Many tour players and top instructors advocate for a single, consistent ball position for all iron shots. The logic is straightforward: when your ball position is constant, your swing's low point stays the same, making solid contact far more repeatable.

**The rule: Position the ball roughly one clubhead width inside your lead heel for all iron shots.**

That's it. 5-iron, 7-iron, pitching wedge. Same spot. Your brain gets one position to remember, and your body gets one motion to groove.

## How It Actually Works

"But wait," you might think, "don't I need the ball back for wedges and forward for long irons?"

Not necessarily. The key insight is that you adjust your stance width, not your ball position.

Here's the process:

1. **Start with feet together**, ball centered between them
2. **Take a small step toward the target** with your lead foot
3. **Take a step back with your trail foot** - larger step for longer clubs, smaller for wedges
4. **The ball stays in place** relative to your lead foot

With a pitching wedge, your stance is narrow. With a 5-iron, it's wider. But that ball? It's always in the same relationship to your front foot.

This approach lets the club's natural loft and shaft length create the appropriate angle of attack. You don't have to manufacture it with setup changes.

## Why This Creates Better Contact

When your ball position is consistent, several good things happen:

**Your low point becomes reliable.** The bottom of your swing arc happens in the same spot every time. That means you can trust your contact.

**Your weight transfer simplifies.** With the ball forward of center, you naturally shift into your lead side through impact. No manipulation needed.

**Practice becomes effective.** Every swing you make on the range reinforces the same motor pattern. You're building actual muscle memory, not constantly adapting to new positions.

**Diagnosis gets easier.** When something goes wrong, you know it's your swing, not your setup. That clarity speeds up improvement.

## The Stance Width Drill

Try this on the range to groove the one-position approach:

1. Put an alignment stick or club on the ground pointing at your target
2. Place a tee one clubhead-width inside where your lead heel will be
3. Set up to a pitching wedge with feet close together, ball on the tee
4. Step your trail foot back a small amount - maybe 6-8 inches
5. Hit 10 shots

Now repeat with a 7-iron:
- Same ball position (on the tee)
- Step your trail foot back further - maybe 10-12 inches
- Hit 10 shots

Finally, with a 5-iron:
- Same ball position
- Even wider stance
- Hit 10 shots

Notice how the ball stays put. Your stance width does the adjusting.

## When to Deviate

The one-position rule works for standard iron shots. You might adjust for:

- **Specialty shots** - A low punch needs the ball back
- **Extreme lies** - Ball above your feet might want a slight adjustment
- **Wind knockdowns** - Moving the ball back reduces trajectory

But for 90% of your iron shots? One position. One less thing to think about.

## What About Driver?

The driver is the exception. With the ball teed up and the club designed to hit on the upswing, you genuinely want the ball forward - off your lead heel or even slightly ahead.

But from the ground, with irons? Simplify. Pick your spot. Trust it.

## The Mental Benefit

Beyond the physical consistency, there's a psychological advantage to the one-position approach.

Golf creates enough decisions. Club selection. Target line. Swing thought. When you remove ball position from the equation, you have more mental bandwidth for what matters.

Step up. Put the ball in its spot. Swing.

That clarity breeds confidence. Confidence creates better swings.

## Try It This Week

Next time you practice:

1. Place a tee one clubhead inside your lead heel
2. Hit every iron to that same spot
3. Only adjust your stance width

Give it 30 minutes. Notice how your contact becomes more consistent. Notice how your brain stops calculating and starts swinging.

The best systems in golf are simple ones. This is one of them.
