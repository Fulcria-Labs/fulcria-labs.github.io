You hit the ball and watch it start left of your target before curving sharply right into the trees. Again. Sound familiar?

That frustrating slice is almost always caused by an out-to-in swing path. Your club is traveling from outside the target line to inside it through impact, putting slice spin on the ball.

The good news: this is one of the most fixable swing faults in golf. With the right understanding and a few targeted drills, you can change your path and start hitting straighter shots.

## What Is an Out-to-In Swing Path?

Imagine a line from your ball to your target. Now imagine your clubhead traveling across that line during impact.

With an out-to-in path, your club approaches the ball from outside that target line and exits to the inside. The clubhead moves from farther away from your body to closer during the strike.

This creates a glancing blow across the ball. When combined with a clubface that is open to the path (but possibly square or even closed to the target), the result is a slice.

The opposite path, in-to-out, is what most tour pros use. The club approaches from inside the target line and exits to the outside, promoting a draw.

## Why You Swing Out-to-In

Understanding the cause helps fix the problem. Most out-to-in swing paths come from one of these issues.

### Starting the Downswing With Your Shoulders

The most common cause. When your shoulders start the downswing by rotating toward the target, your arms and club get thrown outward. This is called coming over the top.

Your body naturally compensates for a lack of lower body movement by using what it can, your upper body. The result is an outside-in club path.

### Standing Too Close to the Ball

When you crowd the ball at address, there is not enough room for your arms to swing on a proper path. You are forced to route the club around your body and back outside.

### Gripping the Club Too Tight

A death grip creates tension in your forearms and shoulders. Tension restricts your ability to drop the club into the slot on the downswing, so you throw it from the top instead.

### Trying to Hit at the Ball Instead of Through It

Focusing on the ball as your target creates a choppy, outside-in motion. The best ball strikers think about swinging through a point well past the ball.

## 5 Drills to Fix Your Out-to-In Swing Path

These drills address the root causes and help you feel a proper inside-out path.

### Drill 1: The Headcover Gate

This simple drill provides instant feedback on your path.

**Setup:**
1. Place a headcover or towel about a grip length behind the ball
2. Position it slightly outside the target line, about two inches

**Execution:**
1. Make swings focusing on not hitting the headcover
2. If you hit it, your path is coming from outside
3. Feel like you are swinging out to the right of the target

**Why it works:** The headcover creates a physical barrier that your club must avoid. Your body naturally finds a more inside path to get around it.

### Drill 2: The Step Drill

This drill teaches proper sequencing with lower body leading.

**Setup:**
1. Take your normal stance with feet together
2. Hold the club at the top of your backswing position

**Execution:**
1. Step toward the target with your lead foot to start the downswing
2. Let your arms drop while your hips rotate
3. Finish the swing

**Why it works:** Stepping forces your lower body to move first. When the lower body leads, your arms naturally drop into the slot instead of throwing outside.

### Drill 3: Right Arm Only Swings

Using just your trail arm reveals your natural path tendency.

**Setup:**
1. Grip the club with only your trail hand (right hand for right-handers)
2. Choke down for control

**Execution:**
1. Make half swings focusing on the feeling of your arm dropping
2. Try to feel like your elbow stays connected to your side on the downswing
3. Swing toward right field (for right-handers)

**Why it works:** Your trail arm controls the club path. Training it to drop instead of throw outward creates lasting change.

### Drill 4: The Wall Drill

A zero-equipment drill you can do at home.

**Setup:**
1. Stand with your back heel about six inches from a wall
2. Take your address position (no club needed)

**Execution:**
1. Make slow backswing motions
2. On the downswing, feel your trail elbow brush against the wall
3. If your elbow moves away from the wall, you are coming over the top

**Why it works:** The wall provides feedback on elbow position. An elbow that stays close to your body on the downswing creates an inside path.

### Drill 5: Drop and Rotate

This is the feel you want to recreate on every swing.

**Setup:**
1. Take your normal address with any club
2. Make a full backswing

**Execution:**
1. From the top, feel like your arms and club drop straight down while doing nothing else
2. Once you feel the drop, rotate your hips hard
3. The sensation should be arms falling, then body turning

**Why it works:** Separating the drop from the rotation helps you feel proper sequencing. Most golfers try to do both at once, which causes the over-the-top move.

## Practice Plan

Changing your swing path takes focused practice. Here is a four-week plan.

**Week 1:** Focus only on the Headcover Gate drill. Hit 20 balls per session, prioritizing path over distance or target.

**Week 2:** Add the Step Drill before each practice session as a warmup. Continue with Headcover Gate for most reps.

**Week 3:** Incorporate Right Arm Only swings. Alternate between right arm only and full swings.

**Week 4:** Start hitting full shots without training aids, but maintain awareness of the feelings from the drills. Use video to check progress.

## Common Mistakes When Working on Swing Path

Avoid these errors that can set back your progress.

### Swinging Too Far to the Right

When told to swing more inside-out, some golfers overdo it. An extremely inside path causes hooks and push shots. Aim for neutral to slightly inside-out, not severely inside.

### Ignoring Face Angle

Path and face work together. If you fix your path but keep an open face, you will hit push slices instead of pull slices. Make sure your grip is neutral and your wrists are not cupped at the top.

### Trying to Feel It on the Downswing

The downswing happens too fast for conscious adjustments. Make changes in your setup, grip, and backswing. Let the downswing be a reaction to good positions.

### Not Using Video

You cannot feel what you are actually doing. Record your swing from behind (down the line view) to see your actual path. Compare it to tour players to understand the difference.

## Using Swing Analyzer to Track Your Path

Modern swing analyzers can measure your club path in degrees. This takes the guesswork out of improvement.

Upload a video of your swing and get instant feedback on whether you are swinging out-to-in, in-to-out, or neutral. Numbers do not lie.

Track your path over time to ensure drills are creating real change. What gets measured gets improved.

## Key Takeaways

An out-to-in swing path causes most slices. Fix the path, fix the slice.

The main causes are: starting with shoulders, standing too close, gripping too tight, and hitting at instead of through the ball.

Use these drills consistently: Headcover Gate, Step Drill, Right Arm Only, Wall Drill, and Drop and Rotate.

Change happens with focused practice over weeks, not days. Film yourself regularly and track improvement.

Your straighter, more powerful ball flight is waiting on the other side of a better swing path.
