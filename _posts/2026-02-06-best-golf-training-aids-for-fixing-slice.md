![Best Golf Training Aids for Fixing a Slice 2026](/assets/images/best-golf-training-aids-for-fixing-slice.webp)

That banana ball curving into the trees is more than frustrating. It costs you strokes, confidence, and probably a few golf balls per round. If you are among the 70% of amateur golfers who struggle with a slice, the right training aid can accelerate your fix dramatically.

But here is the thing: not all training aids work the same way. Some target swing path. Others focus on clubface control. And some address the wrist mechanics that cause an open face at impact. The key is matching the right tool to your specific slice cause.

We have tested and researched the top slice-fixing training aids available in 2026. Here are our picks, with honest pros, cons, and recommendations for who each product suits best.

## Why Training Aids Actually Help Fix a Slice

Before diving into products, let us quickly cover why training aids work better than just hitting more balls at the range.

A slice happens when the clubface is open relative to your swing path at impact. This creates sidespin that curves the ball right (for right-handers). The two main culprits are:

1. **An outside-in swing path** (coming over the top)
2. **An open clubface at impact**

Training aids provide immediate, physical feedback that your brain cannot ignore. Unlike swing thoughts that fade after a few swings, a properly designed training aid forces correct positions and patterns every single rep.

## 1. EyeLine Golf Speed Trap 2.0

**Best Overall for Fixing a Slice**

[AFFILIATE_LINK]

The Speed Trap 2.0 is our top pick for most slicers because it addresses the root cause directly: swing path. This training aid has helped countless golfers eliminate their over-the-top move and start hitting draws.

### How It Works

The Speed Trap features an unbreakable polycarbonate base with adjustable foam rods that create a corridor for your club. Set up the rods to encourage an inside-out path, and swing through without hitting them. If you come over the top, you will hit the rods and get immediate feedback.

### Price

$119 retail, though sales often bring it down to the $100-110 range.

### Pros

- Immediate, unmistakable feedback on path
- Durable construction (rated for 1,000+ sessions)
- Versatile for both slice and hook correction
- Works at home into a net or at the range
- No batteries or apps required

### Cons

- Requires space to set up properly
- Takes a few sessions to dial in rod positions
- Can be frustrating at first if your path is severely outside-in

### Best For

Golfers who slice because of an outside-in swing path. If your divots point left of target or you see the dreaded pull-slice pattern, this is your fix.

## 2. HackMotion Wrist Sensor

**Best for Data-Driven Golfers**

[AFFILIATE_LINK]

If you want to understand exactly why you slice and track your improvement with precision, HackMotion is the gold standard. This wearable sensor measures your wrist angles throughout the swing and provides real-time feedback via an app.

### How It Works

The device straps to your lead wrist and tracks flexion, extension, and radial/ulnar deviation at every point in your swing. The companion app shows exactly where your wrist positions differ from tour averages and provides audio cues during practice. Since wrist position largely controls clubface angle, fixing your wrists fixes your slice.

### Price

$295 for the Core package, $495 for Plus, and $995 for the Pro version with all features.

### Pros

- Precise measurement of what actually controls clubface
- Real-time audio feedback during swings
- Extensive database of tour player data for comparison
- 60-day money-back guarantee
- Works for full swing and putting

### Cons

- Highest price point on this list
- Requires smartphone for full functionality
- Learning curve to interpret the data
- Some golfers prefer feel-based learning over data

### Best For

Serious golfers who want objective measurement, those who have tried other fixes without success, and data-driven players who want to know the "why" behind their slice.

## 3. TRS Slider

**Best for Over-the-Top Swingers**

[AFFILIATE_LINK]

Developed by European Tour winner Robert Rock, the TRS Slider addresses the most common slice cause: a flying trail elbow that throws the club over the top in transition. This innovative aid promotes proper arm position without being overly restrictive.

### How It Works

The Slider consists of a durable seat belt-style strap that connects your torso to your trail elbow. The unique sliding mechanism allows appropriate range of motion during the backswing while preventing the elbow from flying out in the downswing. It trains your trail arm to stay connected and move in sync with your torso.

### Price

$80-100 depending on retailer.

### Pros

- Allows natural movement while preventing the fault
- Developed by a tour professional who fixed his own slice
- Can wear during actual ball striking
- Lightweight and portable
- Effective results reported by many users

### Cons

- Takes practice to groove the feeling without the aid
- May feel restrictive initially
- Less immediate feedback than path-based trainers
- Not a quick fix; requires repetition

### Best For

Golfers whose trail elbow flies out in the downswing, players who struggle to keep their arms connected to their body rotation, and those who come over the top because of arm position rather than body sequence.

## 4. Launch Deck

**Best for Driver Slice**

[AFFILIATE_LINK]

Designed by Tiger Woods' former coach Hank Haney, the Launch Deck specifically targets the driver slice that plagues so many amateurs. If you hit your irons reasonably straight but spray your driver right, this training aid was built for your problem.

### How It Works

The Launch Deck is a mat system with adjustable swing gates that you set for your desired shot shape. Place it down at the range, simulator, or into a net, then swing through the gates and over the "Launch Hurdle." The setup naturally promotes an inside-out path and upward attack angle, both critical for eliminating a driver slice.

### Price

$99 (frequently on sale from original $199 price).

### Pros

- Specifically designed for driver slice issues
- Developed by one of golf's most respected teachers
- 100% money-back guarantee (up to 364 days)
- Adjustable for different shot shapes
- Promotes both path and attack angle improvements

### Cons

- Primarily for driver; less useful for iron slice
- Requires flat surface to set up
- Takes up more space than other aids
- May not address clubface issues if that is your root cause

### Best For

Golfers who slice their driver more than their irons, those who hit down on their driver (negative attack angle), and players looking for a driver-specific solution.

## 5. PlaneMate (Tour Striker Swing Trainer)

**Best for Feel-Based Learners**

[AFFILIATE_LINK]

The PlaneMate uses resistance bands to teach proper swing plane and transition feel. It is particularly effective for golfers who learn better through sensation than visual or technical feedback.

### How It Works

The system includes resistance bands that attach to your body and club. When you take the club back and transition properly, the bands provide comfortable resistance. When you come over the top or get out of plane, you feel immediate tension in the wrong places. The bands teach you to feel professional takeaway and transition positions.

### Price

$160-180 including multiple resistance bands and access to the PlaneMate Protocol training videos.

### Pros

- Excellent for developing feel and proprioception
- Includes multiple band strengths for progression
- Full video training protocol included
- Can hit real balls while using it
- Addresses the transition, where most slices originate

### Cons

- Requires learning curve to use correctly
- Not as immediately intuitive as path-based trainers
- Must follow the protocol for best results
- Bands can wear over time with heavy use

### Best For

Golfers who learn best through feel, those whose slice originates from a poor transition move, and players who want to develop lasting swing changes rather than quick fixes.

## 6. Impact Snap

**Best for Flippers and Casters**

[AFFILIATE_LINK]

If your slice comes from flipping your hands through impact rather than maintaining lag, the Impact Snap provides immediate feedback on proper release mechanics. This 4-time Golf Digest award winner has helped golfers compress the ball and square the face for over a decade.

### How It Works

The Impact Snap is a handheld device with a hinged mechanism. When you achieve proper impact position with your hands ahead of the clubhead, the device makes an audible "snap" sound and a yellow ball rests against your forearm. Flip or cast early, and you get neither feedback. The device trains the motor pattern of a proper, compressed impact.

### Price

$90-110 depending on retailer.

### Pros

- Audible and tactile feedback confirms correct positions
- 4-time Golf Digest "Best Full Swing Training Aid" winner
- Portable and requires no setup
- Helps with impact position for all shots
- Can practice indoors without hitting balls

### Cons

- Does not address swing path directly
- Takes practice to interpret feedback correctly
- May not fix slice if path is the primary issue
- Some golfers find the motion differs from a real swing

### Best For

Golfers who cast or flip at impact, players who struggle to get their hands ahead of the ball, and those whose slice comes from an open face due to early release.

## 7. Tour Striker Smart Ball

**Best Budget Option**

[AFFILIATE_LINK]

At under $40, the Smart Ball offers remarkable value for golfers whose slice stems from disconnection between their arms and body. Used by Justin Rose and endorsed by top instructors like Sean Foley, this simple inflatable ball delivers immediate feedback.

### How It Works

The Smart Ball sits between your forearms during the swing. If your arms stay connected to your body rotation through impact, the ball stays in place. If you disconnect, the arms separate, and the ball falls. This simple mechanic trains synchronized rotation that keeps the clubface square through the hitting zone.

### Price

$30-40.

### Pros

- Best price-to-value ratio on this list
- Immediate, unmistakable feedback
- Used by tour professionals
- Portable and requires no setup
- Eliminates "chicken wing" and arm-dominant swings

### Cons

- Addresses connection, not path directly
- Ball can be distracting for some golfers initially
- Does not work for every slice cause
- Requires proper setup to get full benefit

### Best For

Budget-conscious golfers, those whose arms disconnect from body rotation, players with a "chicken wing" follow-through, and anyone starting their slice-fix journey.

## How to Choose the Right Training Aid for Your Slice

With seven solid options, how do you pick the right one? Start by diagnosing your specific slice cause.

### Match the Tool to Your Problem

**Outside-in swing path?**
Your divots point left of target, and you might hit pull-slices. Choose the **Speed Trap 2.0** or **Launch Deck**.

**Open clubface from wrist issues?**
You lose shots right even when path feels okay. Choose **HackMotion** or **Impact Snap**.

**Flying trail elbow?**
Your right arm (for righties) detaches in the downswing. Choose the **TRS Slider**.

**Poor transition and plane?**
You rush from the top and throw the club outside. Choose the **PlaneMate**.

**Arm-body disconnection?**
Your arms work independently of your rotation. Choose the **Smart Ball**.

### Consider Your Learning Style

- **Data lovers:** HackMotion provides numbers and comparisons
- **Feel players:** PlaneMate and TRS Slider teach through sensation
- **Visual/physical learners:** Speed Trap gives immediate visible feedback

### Budget Considerations

If you are unsure where to start, the **Tour Striker Smart Ball** at $35 is low-risk and addresses a common issue. If you want to invest in one tool that covers the most common slice cause, the **Speed Trap 2.0** at around $119 is hard to beat.
