# 10 Golf Practice Games That Make Practice Fun (And Actually Work)

Hitting ball after ball on the range with no structure isn't practice—it's exercise. Your brain disengages, your swing gets sloppy, and you leave having burned calories but not improved.

Practice games change that. They add stakes, force focus, and simulate course pressure. You actually get better.

Here are 10 games you can play solo or with friends that turn range time into real improvement.

## Solo Games

### 1. Par 18

**What it is:** Play a 9-hole round using your imagination and real shots.

**How to play:**
- Pick a target for each "hole"
- Holes 1-3: Par 4s (driver + iron)
- Holes 4-6: Par 3s (one shot to the target)
- Holes 7-9: Par 5s (three shots to reach the target)
- Score each hole based on where your shot lands relative to the target

**Scoring:**
- Hit your landing zone = par
- Miss by 10+ yards = bogey
- Perfect pin-seeker = birdie
- Shank/top/chunk = double bogey

**Why it works:** Forces you to change clubs constantly and create course scenarios. No mindless 7-iron blocks.

### 2. 21

**What it is:** Chipping/pitching game targeting different distances.

**How to play:**
- Set up three targets at 20, 40, and 60 yards
- Hit 7 balls total
- Score based on proximity:
  - Inside 3 feet = 3 points
  - Inside 6 feet = 2 points
  - Inside 10 feet = 1 point
  - Miss the green = -1 point
- First to 21 wins (against yourself or a friend)

**Why it works:** Forces you to dial in distance control with different wedges and swing lengths.

### 3. Nine-Shot Challenge

**What it is:** Hit all 9 ball flights in a row.

**The 9 shots:**
1. Low draw
2. Low straight
3. Low fade
4. Medium draw
5. Medium straight
6. Medium fade
7. High draw
8. High straight
9. High fade

**How to play:**
- Must complete each shot successfully before moving to the next
- "Success" means the ball does what you intended
- Start over if you miss one
- Time yourself and try to beat your record

**Why it works:** Develops complete ball control. Exposes which shots you avoid (probably the ones you need most).

### 4. Up and Down Challenge

**What it is:** Simulate greenside situations and keep score.

**How to play:**
- Find a practice green with a chipping area
- Drop 10 balls in different lies
- For each ball: chip on, then putt out
- Track how many you get up-and-down

**Scoring:**
- 7/10 = solid short game
- 8/10 = you're saving strokes
- 9-10/10 = tour-level

**Why it works:** This is literally what happens on the course. Practice it.

### 5. The Ladder

**What it is:** Distance control with one club.

**How to play:**
- Pick your pitching wedge
- Hit shots to 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 yards
- Each shot must carry further than the last
- Start over if you skip a rung or fall short

**Why it works:** Most amateurs have 2-3 wedge distances. You should have 6.

## Games With Friends

### 6. Closest to the Pin Showdown

**What it is:** Classic competition on specific targets.

**How to play:**
- Pick a target (flag, sign, yardage marker)
- Everyone hits one shot
- Closest wins the hole
- Play 9 or 18 holes

**Variations:**
- Each person picks a hole (so you don't always play to 150 yards)
- Loser picks the next target
- Add "match play" rules where winning a hole is worth 1 point

**Why it works:** Pressure. When a $5 beer is on the line, suddenly that 8-iron means something.

### 7. Fairway Frenzy

**What it is:** Driver accuracy competition.

**How to play:**
- Find a range with a marked "fairway" (or agree on boundaries)
- Each player hits 10 drives
- Score +1 for hitting the fairway, -1 for missing
- Most points after 10 wins

**Bonus rule:** If you split the fairway (dead center), it's worth +2.

**Why it works:** You can crush it 280 but what matters is 280 in play.

### 8. Horse (Golf Edition)

**What it is:** Like basketball Horse but with specialty shots.

**How to play:**
- First player calls and hits a shot (e.g., "low hook around the tree to the 150 marker")
- If they make it, everyone else must replicate it
- Fail = you get a letter
- Spell H-O-R-S-E and you're out

**Shot ideas:**
- One-handed chips
- Punch shot under a branch
- Flop shot to a tight pin
- Fade around an obstacle
- Full swing with feet together

**Why it works:** Forces creativity and shot-making skills that come up in real rounds.

### 9. Two-Club Challenge

**What it is:** Play 9 imaginary holes with only 2 clubs.

**How to play:**
- Each player picks 2 clubs (plus putter if on practice green)
- Play 9 holes Par 36 (mix of par 3s, 4s, 5s)
- Can't use other clubs even if situation calls for it

**Common picks:**
- 7-iron + 56-degree wedge
- 5-iron + pitching wedge
- Hybrid + lob wedge

**Why it works:** Develops versatility. You learn to manufacture shots when you can't just reach for the "right" club.

### 10. Beat the Pro

**What it is:** Head-to-head against a designated "pro."

**How to play:**
- One player is the "pro" and gets no handicap
- Other players get shots based on skill difference
- Play 9-hole match play
- Pro must win outright; challengers win ties

**Example:**
- Pro plays scratch
- Friend 1 gets 2 shots (can use them any hole)
- Friend 2 gets 4 shots

**Why it works:** Balances skill levels so everyone stays engaged. The "pro" feels pressure; challengers feel they have a chance.

## Making Games Work

### Track Your Scores

Write down your results. "Par 18" means nothing if you don't know whether you shot 22 or 28. Trends reveal what's improving and what needs work.

### Change Your Games Monthly

Playing the same game gets stale. Rotate through different games to work different skills.

### Add Real Stakes

Doesn't have to be money. Loser buys coffee. Winner picks the music on the ride home. Small stakes create real focus.

## Use Video to Level Up

Record your practice games with [Swing Analyzer](https://swing.fulcria.com). When you hit that perfect stinger in the Nine-Shot Challenge, save it. When you chunk the chip in Up and Down Challenge, analyze why.

Practice games create pressure. Video shows what happens to your swing under that pressure. Together, they build a game that holds up when it counts.

## Your Challenge

Next range session, pick one game from this list and commit to playing it for the full bucket. No mindless hitting. Score yourself honestly.

You'll leave tired but knowing exactly where you stand—and with a plan for next time.
