Attack angle is one of the most important—yet least understood—numbers in golf. It's the difference between crushing your driver and hitting weak pop-ups. It's why some players stripe their irons while others hit every shot thin.

Here's what you need to know about attack angle and how to optimize it for every club.

## What Is Attack Angle?

Attack angle (also called angle of attack) is the vertical direction the clubhead is moving at impact—measured in degrees up or down.

**Positive attack angle:** The club is moving upward at impact (hitting up on the ball)
**Negative attack angle:** The club is moving downward at impact (hitting down on the ball)

A launch monitor like TrackMan or GCQuad measures this precisely, but you can feel it in your shots.

## Why Attack Angle Matters

Attack angle directly affects:

1. **Launch angle** - Hitting up launches higher, hitting down launches lower (all else equal)
2. **Spin rate** - Downward strikes create more spin, upward strikes create less
3. **Carry distance** - Optimal attack angle maximizes carry
4. **Ball flight** - Steep angles produce different shot shapes than shallow angles

For driver, the difference between -5 degrees and +5 degrees can be 20-30 yards of carry distance.

## Ideal Attack Angles by Club

Different clubs require different attack angles for optimal performance:

### Driver
**Tour average:** +1 to +5 degrees (slightly up)
**Why:** Driver has the least loft, so hitting up adds launch without adding spin

Hitting down on driver increases spin dramatically, reducing distance. A positive attack angle with driver:
- Lowers spin rate
- Increases launch angle
- Maximizes carry distance

### Fairway Woods
**Tour average:** -1 to -3 degrees (slightly down)
**Why:** Ball is on the ground, so you need a descending blow to compress it

Even though they're long clubs, fairway woods need a shallow-but-downward strike.

### Irons
**Tour average:**
- Long irons: -3 to -4 degrees
- Mid irons: -4 to -5 degrees
- Short irons: -5 to -6 degrees

**Why:** Steeper attack angles help compress the ball and create the spin needed for stopping power on greens.

### Wedges
**Tour average:** -4 to -6 degrees
**Why:** Wedge loft is already high, so a descending blow creates maximum spin without ballooning the shot.

## Common Attack Angle Problems

### Problem: Hitting Down Too Much on Driver

**Symptoms:**
- High spin, low launch (the dreaded "balloon" that doesn't carry)
- Teed ball and the driver face both look worn on the top half
- Your divots go forward of where you tee the ball

**Fix:** Move the ball forward in your stance, feel like you're "hitting up" through impact, tilt your spine slightly away from the target at address.

### Problem: Hitting Up on Irons

**Symptoms:**
- Thin shots, topped shots
- Low launch with no spin
- Ball doesn't take a divot or divot is behind the ball
- Chunks and fat shots

**Fix:** Ball position middle to slightly forward of center, weight favoring your lead side at impact, feel like you're pressing the handle forward.

### Problem: Too Steep on Irons

**Symptoms:**
- Deep divots
- Shots that balloon and come up short
- Occasional shanks
- Good strikes but inconsistent distances

**Fix:** Feel a shallower approach, let your arms swing more around your body, check that you're not sliding toward the target on the downswing.

## How to Check Your Attack Angle

### With Technology
A launch monitor gives you exact numbers. Look for:
- TrackMan, Foresight, FlightScope at fitting studios
- Home launch monitors like Garmin R10 or Mevo+
- Driving ranges with built-in tech

### Without Technology
**For driver:**
- Tee up a ball and place a second tee 2 inches in front
- If you hit the forward tee, you're hitting down too much
- The goal is to clip the ball and miss the forward tee

**For irons:**
- Your divot location tells the story
- Divot starting after the ball = proper descending blow
- Divot starting before the ball = hitting up

## Drills to Optimize Attack Angle

### Driver: Hit Up Drill
1. Tee the ball higher than normal
2. Address the ball off your lead toe
3. Feel like you're swinging up a ramp
4. Practice in slow motion to groove the feel

### Irons: Low Point Drill
1. Draw a line in the grass (or use a club on the ground)
2. Make practice swings trying to brush the grass after the line
3. The line represents ball position
4. Divot should start at or after the line

### The Coin Drill
1. Place a coin 2 inches in front of the ball
2. For driver: avoid the coin
3. For irons: hit the coin after striking the ball

## The Relationship Between Attack Angle and Club Path

Attack angle works with club path to determine ball flight:

- Steep attack angle + out-to-in path = pulls, pull-slices
- Steep attack angle + in-to-out path = push-draws (but can cause shanks)
- Shallow attack angle + out-to-in path = fades
- Shallow attack angle + in-to-out path = draws

This is why fixing your attack angle alone doesn't fix ball flight—but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Driver: Hit up** - Positive attack angle (+1 to +5) maximizes distance
2. **Irons: Hit down** - Negative attack angle creates compression and spin
3. **Check your divots** - Location tells you about attack angle
4. **Match angle to club** - Each club has an optimal attack angle
5. **Get measured** - Launch monitor data removes guesswork

Attack angle is the foundation of consistent ball striking. Once you understand what yours is and what it should be, you can make the adjustments that lead to longer, straighter shots.
