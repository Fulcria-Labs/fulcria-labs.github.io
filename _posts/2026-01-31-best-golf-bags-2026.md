## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I replace my golf bag?
Most quality bags last 5-10 years with normal use. Replace when zippers fail, straps break, or stands become unreliable.

### Is a 14-way divider worth it?
For cart bags, yes—it keeps clubs organized and easy to grab. For stand bags, 4-5 way is fine and keeps weight down.

### Can I use a stand bag on a cart?
Yes, but cart-specific features (like cart strap pass-through) won't be optimized. Most stand bags work fine on carts.

### What's the best bag for a beginner?
Start with a mid-range stand bag like the Mizuno BR-D3. It's versatile enough for walking or riding and won't break the bank.

---

## Final Recommendations

**For Walkers:** Get the **Mizuno BR-D3** for best value or **PING Hoofer** for premium comfort.

**For Riders:** The **Cobra Ultralight Pro** offers the best features for the price. Splurge on **Vessel Lux Cart 2.0** if budget allows.

**For Both:** The **Titleist Hybrid 14** handles walking and riding without major compromises.

**For Push Cart Users:** The **Sun Mountain Maverick** is designed specifically for your needs.
