Here's a simple truth: if you're taking more than 36 putts per round, you're leaving strokes on the course. Many recreational golfers average 40+ putts—that's 4+ unnecessary strokes every round.

**The good news? Unlike the physically demanding full swing, putting is a skill anyone can master regardless of age or athletic ability.** It just requires understanding the fundamentals and deliberate practice.

## Why Putting Deserves Your Attention

Consider how tour pros allocate practice time: **50% putting, 50% everything else.** Yet most amateurs spend maybe 10 minutes rolling a few putts before a round.

Putting offers the highest return on practice investment in golf. A better putter makes fewer 3-putts, converts more par-saving opportunities, and capitalizes on birdie chances. These aren't dramatic improvements—they're quiet, consistent strokes shaved from your score.

## The Setup: Foundation of Consistent Putting

### Eye Position

Your eyes should be directly over or slightly inside the ball. This is non-negotiable.

**How to check:** Take your setup, hold a ball at your eye level, and drop it. It should land on or just inside the ball you're putting. If it lands outside the line, you're too far from the ball. Inside? Too close.

### Athletic Posture

Many golfers get too "relaxed" over putts. Instead:

- **Bend from the hips** (not the waist)
- Keep your **back straight, bum out**
- **Flex your knees slightly**
- Let your **arms hang naturally**

This creates stability and allows the shoulders to work like a pendulum.

### Ball Position

Position the ball slightly forward of center in your stance. This ensures you're striking the ball with a slightly ascending stroke, promoting true roll rather than skidding or bouncing.

### Grip

Here's a liberating truth: **there is no "correct" putting grip.** World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler uses the claw. Many tour pros use left-hand-low. Traditional overlapping works too.

What matters:
- Your hands work together as a unit
- Wrist action is minimized
- The grip feels natural and repeatable

Experiment with different styles. The "best" grip is whichever helps you roll the ball on your intended line.

## The Stroke: Pendulum, Not Poke

### Shoulder-Driven Motion

The putting stroke should feel like your shoulders are rocking back and through while everything else stays quiet.

- **Shoulders rock** like a pendulum
- **Arms stay connected** to your chest
- **Hands and wrists stay passive**
- **Lower body stays dead still**

Think of your arms, hands, and putter as one unit—a triangle that maintains its shape throughout the stroke.

### Tempo Consistency

Your backstroke and through-stroke should have the same tempo and length. A common amateur flaw is a long backstroke followed by deceleration through impact.

**Better:** Match your backstroke to your follow-through. For a 10-foot putt, perhaps 6 inches back, 6 inches through—at the same pace in both directions.

### Body Stillness

Stay still over the putt. Don't just focus on keeping your head down—your entire body should remain stable:

- No lateral sway
- No lifting up through impact
- No peeking at the hole before contact

Think "quiet body, moving shoulders."

## Distance Control: The Real Skill

**Distance control matters more than line.** You can misread a putt's break slightly and still make it or have a tap-in. Get the speed wrong, and you're facing a 6-footer coming back.

### The Lag Drill

This drill from tour coach Adam Smith transforms distance control:

1. Place four tees forming a 4-foot square on the practice green
2. Walk 30 feet away (about 10 normal strides)
3. Putt toward the square, aiming to finish inside it
4. Goal: 18 balls in a row inside the square
5. If one misses, restart from zero

Why it works: If the hole were in that square's center, your longest second putt would be 2 feet. Consistently landing in a 4x4 area from 30 feet eliminates three-putts.

### Speed Reading

When reading a putt, ask: "Where would the ball need to *stop* if there were no hole?"

For a 10-footer with 6 inches of break, the ball needs enough speed to reach 6 inches past the hole if it doesn't fall. This mental model helps match speed to break.

## Starting Line: Hit Your Target

A great read with poor execution still misses. The gate drill builds precision:

### The Gate Drill

1. Place two tees 3 feet from the hole, forming a gate just wider than the ball
2. Practice putting through the gate
3. Goal: 9 balls in a row through the gate
4. Miss one, restart

The challenge reveals how quickly your eyes learn to aim the putter face with clear feedback. Once consistent on the practice green, starting lines become automatic on the course.

## Green Reading Basics

For an in-depth guide to reading greens, including the AimPoint method used by tour pros, see our complete [green reading guide](/blog/how-to-read-greens-golf/).

### Walk the Full Putt

Don't just read from behind the ball. Walk to the hole and look back. Sometimes the break is obvious from the low side that wasn't visible from behind.

### Trust Your Feet

As you walk your putt line, feel which way the slope tilts. Your feet detect subtle breaks your eyes might miss.

### Trust Your First Read

Most golfers over-read or second-guess themselves. Your initial instinct about break direction is usually correct. The mistake is typically in *amount* of break, not direction.

### Dominant Eye

Everyone has a dominant eye. Knowing yours helps position your head correctly. Close one eye, then the other, while looking at a distant object. The eye that keeps the object still is dominant. Position that eye over or near the ball.

## Common Putting Mistakes

### 1. Deceleration

The "yips" often stem from slowing down through impact. If you decelerate, your putter face can twist, sending the ball off-line. Commit to accelerating through the ball, even on short putts.

### 2. Death Grip

Squeezing the putter creates tension that travels up your arms, killing feel. Light grip pressure—like holding a tube of toothpaste without squeezing any out.

### 3. Peeking Too Soon

Looking up before impact moves your body, changing the putter path. Discipline yourself to hear the ball fall rather than watching it.

### 4. Inconsistent Routine

Tour pros use the same routine for every putt. One practice stroke? Two? It doesn't matter—as long as it's the same every time. Inconsistent routines breed inconsistent strokes.

### 5. Neglecting Short Putts

Everyone practices lag putting. Few practice 3-footers. Yet those short putts are where strokes are truly saved or lost.

## Practice Strategy

### Quality Over Quantity

Spending 30 minutes putting aimlessly helps less than 10 focused minutes with specific drills.

### The 3-5-7 Drill

- Make 10 putts from 3 feet
- Make 5 putts from 5 feet
- Make 3 putts from 7 feet

This builds confidence from short range while challenging accuracy at medium distance.

### Vary Your Breaks

Don't putt from the same spot repeatedly. Move around the hole, facing different breaks. Golf rarely gives you the same putt twice.

## Equipment Matters

Getting fit for a putter is just as valuable as driver fitting—more so, since you use it more often.

- **Length** affects eye position over the ball
- **Lie angle** affects where the face aims at setup
- **Grip size** affects wrist action
- **Head style** (blade vs. mallet) affects stroke type

Most golfers have never been fit for their putter. A session with a fitting professional can reveal why you consistently miss in one direction.

## Mental Approach

### Commit to Your Line

Indecision over the ball leads to steering and manipulation. Once you've read the putt and taken your stance, trust it. If doubt creeps in, step back and restart your routine.

### Expect to Make It

Top putters approach every putt expecting it to go in. This isn't delusion—it's confidence that allows a free, committed stroke. Expecting to miss breeds tentative strokes that cause misses.

### Three-Putt Immunity

The player who fears three-putts creates them. Focus on rolling the ball to the right spot with the right speed. Distance control makes three-putts nearly impossible.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Eyes over the ball, athletic posture.** Setup determines consistency.

2. **Shoulder pendulum, quiet body.** The stroke is simple—don't complicate it.

3. **Distance control trumps line.** Speed is the primary skill.

4. **Practice with purpose.** Drills like the lag drill and gate drill build real skills.

5. **Commit to your read.** Doubt causes more misses than bad reads.

Putting doesn't require athleticism, strength, or perfect technique. It requires understanding a few fundamentals and practicing deliberately. The strokes you save on the green are the easiest strokes to save anywhere in golf.

Start spending more time on the practice green. Your scorecard will thank you.
