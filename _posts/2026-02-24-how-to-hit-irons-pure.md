# How to Hit Irons Pure: The Complete Guide to Solid Contact

That sound. You know it when you hear it—the crisp click of an iron struck pure. The ball launches low, takes one hop, and spins back.

Most amateurs hear it maybe once a round. Tour players hear it on almost every swing.

The difference isn't talent. It's understanding what makes pure contact happen—and training the right moves until they're automatic.

## Why You're Not Hitting Irons Pure

Before the fixes, understand the problems.

### The Fat Shot Problem

When you hit behind the ball, the club is bottoming out too early. Your lowest point is behind the ball instead of in front of it.

This happens because:
- Your weight stays on the back foot
- Your upper body leans away from the target
- Your hands are behind the ball at impact
- Early release of the wrist angles

Fat shots feel awful and go nowhere. The turf absorbs all the energy meant for the ball.

### The Thin Shot Problem

Thin shots are actually the opposite mistake—but often come from trying to fix fat shots.

When golfers hit fat, they instinctively lift up through impact to avoid the ground. Now the club bottoms out too high, catching the ball in the teeth.

Other thin shot causes:
- Standing up in the downswing
- Pulling the handle up instead of through
- Ball position too far forward
- Early extension (hips going toward the ball)

### The Real Issue: Low Point Control

Pure iron contact requires hitting the ball first, then taking a divot in front of it.

That means the lowest point of your swing arc must be 2-4 inches ahead of the ball. Not at the ball. Not behind it. In front.

Tour players do this consistently. Amateurs rarely do.

## The Keys to Pure Contact

### Key 1: Forward Shaft Lean

At impact, your hands need to be ahead of the clubhead. This delofts the club slightly and ensures you're hitting down on the ball.

**The feel:** Your hands lead the clubhead through impact. The shaft leans toward the target.

**The mistake:** Trying to help the ball up by flipping the wrists. This adds loft and moves the low point behind the ball.

**The drill:** Hit punch shots with a 7-iron. Finish with your hands at hip height, shaft leaning forward. The ball should fly low and straight. This is the impact position you want.

### Key 2: Weight Forward at Impact

At impact, 70-80% of your weight should be on your lead foot. This is non-negotiable for pure iron contact.

**The feel:** Pushing into your left foot (for right-handers) as you start down. Your left hip clears and creates space.

**The mistake:** Hanging back on the right side, trying to "stay behind the ball." This works for driver—not irons.

**The drill:** Hit shots with your feet together. You can't hang back with this stance. The ball will be struck clean.

### Key 3: Proper Ball Position

For most iron shots, ball position should be just forward of center in your stance.

- Short irons (9, PW, wedges): Center of stance
- Mid irons (6, 7, 8): One ball forward of center
- Long irons (4, 5): Two balls forward of center

**The feel:** Looking down, you see the ball slightly ahead of your sternum for mid-irons.

**The mistake:** Playing the ball too far forward (causes thin shots) or too far back (promotes steep, fat contact).

**The drill:** Put alignment sticks on the ground forming a "T"—one pointing at target, one perpendicular showing ball position. Use this during practice to build consistency.

### Key 4: Controlled Arm Extension

Your arms should extend through the ball, not before it. Many amateurs straighten their arms too early, throwing away the angles that create compression.

**The feel:** Arms stay soft and connected through the downswing. You "punch" through the ball with your body rotation, not your arms.

**The mistake:** Casting the club from the top, straightening arms immediately in the downswing. This is the classic early release.

**The drill:** Take your address position, then drop your trail arm off the club. Make swings with just your lead arm, focusing on keeping the arm connected to your body through impact.

## The Best Drills for Pure Iron Contact

### Drill 1: The Tee Drill

Place a tee in the ground about 4 inches in front of your ball (toward the target). Your goal: hit the ball first, then clip the tee with your follow-through.

This forces your low point forward. If you hit fat, you miss the tee. The feedback is instant.

Start with half swings and work up to full speed.

### Drill 2: The Towel Drill

Place a folded towel about 6 inches behind your ball. Hit shots without touching the towel.

If you hit the towel, you've hit fat. The towel provides immediate feedback without damaging your club.

### Drill 3: The Line Drill

Draw a line in the sand of a bunker (or use a piece of tape on the practice mat). Place the ball on the line. After your shot, check where you contacted the ground.

You want the club to enter just ahead of the line and exit well in front of it. This creates that ball-first contact.

### Drill 4: 9-to-3 Swings

Make controlled swings where your hands go from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock. Focus purely on making clean contact.

This removes the complications of a full swing and lets you feel proper impact. When you're hitting these pure, gradually increase swing length.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Trying to Help the Ball Up

The loft on your irons is designed to get the ball airborne. You don't need to help it.

When you try to lift the ball, you flip your wrists and hit thin or fat shots. Trust the loft.

### Moving Off the Ball

Some players slide their hips too much in the backswing, moving their head and center behind the ball. This makes it hard to get back to the ball at impact.

Stay centered. Your head should move very little during the swing.

### Steep Angle of Attack (for Most Players)

While hitting down on irons is correct, hitting down too steeply creates problems—especially with long irons.

Tour players hit down 4-5 degrees with a 7-iron. Amateurs often hit down 8-10 degrees. This creates too much spin and inconsistent distance.

### Death Grip

Squeezing the club too tightly kills your ability to release it properly. Hold the club firmly but not tightly. Think 5 out of 10 on grip pressure.

## How to Practice Iron Contact

Don't just beat balls on the range. Practice with purpose.

**Quality over quantity:** 30 focused shots beat 100 mindless swings.

**Use feedback:** Every drill above gives you instant feedback on contact quality.

**Vary your targets:** Hit 3 shots to one target, then switch. Course conditions aren't repetitive—your practice shouldn't be either.

**Practice from less-than-perfect lies:** When you can hit irons pure from tight lies and slight slopes, your game will transfer to the course.

**Film your swing:** Phone cameras are free. Check that you're actually making the positions you think you're making.

## The Path Forward

Pure iron contact isn't something you achieve overnight. It's a skill developed through deliberate practice.

Start with the tee drill. It's simple, provides instant feedback, and builds the fundamental skill—forward low point.

When that feels natural, add the other drills. Each addresses a specific element of pure contact.

Within a few weeks of focused practice, you'll notice the change. Fat shots become less frequent. Thin shots disappear. And that crisp sound of pure contact? You'll hear it more and more often.

The difference between a scrambling 95-shooter and a ball-striking 85-shooter often comes down to one thing: consistent iron contact.

Now you know how to get it.
