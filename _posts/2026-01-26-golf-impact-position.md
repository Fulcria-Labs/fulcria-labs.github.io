  title: Golf Impact Position Guide - Keys to Better Ball Striking

Every swing comes down to one moment: impact. You can have a beautiful backswing and perfect tempo, but if impact is off, the shot fails. This is where ball striking lives.

The good news? Impact position is remarkably similar across all great players. Learn what it looks like, and you have a target to train toward.

## What Proper Impact Looks Like

At impact, a good golfer's body positions are predictable:

### The Hands

Your hands are **ahead of the ball**. This is called "shaft lean" or "forward press at impact." The handle of the club points toward your lead hip—not at the ball or behind it.

This forward shaft lean:
- Compresses the ball against the clubface
- Creates that "ball-first, turf-second" contact
- Delivers the loft you want (not more)
- Produces a penetrating ball flight

**Key checkpoint**: At impact, your hands should be roughly above your lead thigh, not above the ball.

### The Clubface

The clubface is **square to your target line** (or very close to it). For most shots, this means the face points where you want the ball to start.

The face angle at impact determines 75-85% of where the ball starts. Path influences curve, but face determines start direction.

### The Hips

Your hips are **open to the target**—typically 30-45 degrees open at impact. The belt buckle is past the ball, moving toward the target.

This open hip position:
- Creates space for your hands to swing through
- Ensures proper sequencing from the [downswing](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/)
- Transfers weight onto the lead foot
- Allows the body to keep rotating through impact

### The Shoulders

Your shoulders are closer to square than your hips—maybe 10-20 degrees open at impact. This "hip-shoulder separation" is a power source, not something you consciously create.

The lead shoulder is higher than the trail shoulder at impact (for a right-hander, the left shoulder is higher). This helps create the proper descending angle of attack with irons.

### The Weight

Approximately 80% of your weight is on your **lead foot** at impact. The back heel is starting to lift off the ground or has already lifted.

This isn't a thought—it's a result. If you're sequencing correctly from the ground up, the weight shift happens naturally.

## Common Impact Mistakes

### 1. Flipping (Hands Behind the Ball)

**What it looks like**: The clubhead passes the hands before impact. The shaft leans away from the target, adding loft and turning a 7-iron into a 9-iron.

**The result**: Fat shots, thin shots, high weak balls, inconsistent distance.

**Why it happens**: Trying to "help" the ball into the air, or compensating for an open clubface.

**The fix**: Trust that shaft lean creates a lower, more compressed ball flight that actually flies farther. Practice the towel drill (below).

### 2. Chicken Wing (Lead Arm Collapses)

**What it looks like**: The lead elbow bends and points toward the target at impact instead of staying connected and rotating around.

**The result**: Loss of power, inconsistent contact, blocked shots right.

**Why it happens**: Trying to lift the ball, decelerating through impact, or body stops rotating.

**The fix**: Keep your chest rotating through the ball. The arms follow the body—they don't lead it.

### 3. Standing Up (Early Extension)

**What it looks like**: Your body straightens toward the ball through impact, moving your hips closer to the ball than they were at address.

**The result**: Toe hits, blocks, hooks, and shanks—your hand path has nowhere to go.

**Why it happens**: Incorrect sequencing, hanging back on the rear foot, or physical limitations in hip mobility.

**The fix**: Feel like you maintain your spine angle and stay in your posture through the ball. Your rear end stays on an imaginary wall behind you.

### 4. Casting (Releasing Early)

**What it looks like**: The wrist angles release before impact, throwing the clubhead at the ball instead of letting it lag.

**The result**: Weak shots, loss of compression, hitting behind the ball.

**Why it happens**: Trying to hit "at" the ball instead of through it, or starting the downswing with the arms instead of the body.

**The fix**: Focus on your [downswing sequence](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/). When the body leads, the hands naturally lag.

### 5. Cupped Lead Wrist

**What it looks like**: The back of your lead hand bends toward the sky at impact instead of staying flat or slightly bowed.

**The result**: Open clubface, slices, added loft, weak contact.

**Why it happens**: Grip issues, fear of closing the face, or physical limitations.

**The fix**: Work on maintaining a flat or slightly bowed lead wrist through impact. The knuckle drill helps build awareness.

## The Impact Position Checklist

Use this checklist to assess your impact:

- [ ] Hands ahead of the ball (shaft leaning toward target)
- [ ] Hips open (belt buckle past the ball)
- [ ] Weight on lead foot (~80%)
- [ ] Lead shoulder higher than trail shoulder
- [ ] Clubface square to target
- [ ] Lead wrist flat or slightly bowed
- [ ] Eyes on the ball
- [ ] Head behind the ball (for irons)

## Drills for Better Impact

### Towel Drill (Anti-Flip)

Place a towel 4-6 inches behind the ball. Make practice swings that don't touch the towel. This forces you to strike ball first with shaft lean—if you flip, you hit the towel.

**Progress**: Start with half swings, then three-quarter swings, then full swings at reduced speed.

### Impact Bag Drill

An impact bag (or old duffel bag stuffed with towels) lets you practice pressing into the impact position without worrying about the ball. Set up to the bag and "swing" into it, feeling:
- Hands ahead
- Hips open
- Weight forward
- Lead wrist flat

Hold the impact position for 3 seconds. This builds muscle memory for the correct position.

### Preset Impact Drill

Address the ball, then preset your body into an impact position:
- Shift your weight forward
- Open your hips slightly
- Press your hands ahead of the ball

Now swing back and return to that position. You're training your body to recognize where it should be.

### Punch Shot Drill

Hit punch shots with your follow-through stopping at waist height. This limits the "throw" motion and encourages hands-ahead impact. Focus on quality of strike, not distance.

### Alignment Stick Feedback

Place an alignment stick in the ground about 12 inches ahead of the ball, angled toward you. Make half swings—if your hands flip, you'll hit the stick. If you maintain proper shaft lean, you swing under it.

### Slow-Motion Impact Training

Make full swings at 25% speed, freezing at impact. Check your positions:
- Are your hips open?
- Are your hands ahead?
- Is your weight forward?

This conscious practice becomes unconscious over time.

## What Impact Feels Like

Good impact often feels different than you expect:

**It feels like you're hitting down, even though the ball goes up.** The ball's loft does the work—you don't need to lift it.

**It feels like you're "covering" the ball.** Your chest stays over the ball through impact rather than leaning away.

**It feels compressed and solid.** The sweet spot makes a distinct sound, and there's minimal vibration.

**It feels like your arms are passive.** The body is doing the work; the arms are just connecting the body to the club.

**It feels like you're swinging through, not at.** The ball is just in the way of your swing to the target.

## How Video Analysis Helps

You can't see your own impact—it happens too fast. But [video analysis](/blog/phone-golf-swing-video/) can freeze that critical moment.

Look for:
- Hand position relative to the ball
- Hip rotation amount
- Shaft angle
- Weight distribution
- Head position

Many golfers are surprised by what they see. They feel like their hands are ahead, but video shows otherwise. Or they think they're rotating through, but video reveals they're stuck.

[AI swing analyzers](/blog/how-ai-analyzes-golf-swing/) can measure these positions frame by frame, giving you objective data about your impact position without guesswork.

## Building Better Impact Takes Time

Impact position is the result of everything before it. You can't consciously arrange your body in 0.2 seconds. But you can:

1. **Train the sequence**: A proper [backswing](/blog/golf-backswing/) and [downswing](/blog/golf-downswing-sequence/) naturally produce good impact
2. **Build awareness**: Slow-motion practice and video feedback show you what's happening
3. **Groove the feeling**: Impact bag work and preset drills create muscle memory
4. **Trust the process**: Good impact feels different than you expect at first
5. **Continue through**: Impact isn't the end—master the [release](/blog/golf-release/) for maximum power transfer

Focus on the positions. Trust the training. Let impact happen.
