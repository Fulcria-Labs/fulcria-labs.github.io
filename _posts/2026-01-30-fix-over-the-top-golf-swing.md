The over-the-top move is the #1 swing flaw among amateur golfers. It causes slices, pulls, weak contact, and endless frustration. But here's the good news: it's fixable with the right understanding and drills.

## What Does "Over the Top" Mean?

Coming over the top means your club moves **outside** the ideal swing path during the downswing. Instead of dropping the club into the "slot" on an inside path, you throw it outward toward the ball. The result is a steep, out-to-in swing that produces:

- **Slices** (ball curves hard right for right-handed golfers)
- **Pulls** (ball starts left and stays left)
- **Weak pop-ups** with the driver
- **Deep divots** pointing left
- Loss of distance and consistency

If you're hitting pulls with short irons and slices with longer clubs, over the top is almost certainly your issue.

## The Root Causes

Understanding *why* you come over the top is essential to fixing it. The main culprits:

### 1. Arms Dominate the Downswing
The most common cause. Instead of letting your lower body lead, you start the downswing by throwing your arms at the ball. This immediately pushes the club outside the proper path.

### 2. Poor Weight Transfer
If you stay stuck on your back foot, your body can't rotate through properly. The arms have nowhere to go except over the top.

### 3. Early Hip Spin (Instead of Bump)
Some golfers spin their hips too early without shifting forward first. This stalls rotation and forces an over-the-top compensation.

### 4. Too Much Wrist Extension at the Top
An excessively "cupped" wrist at the top can preset an over-the-top path. The club face opens, and you instinctively throw from outside to square it.

### 5. Wrong Mental Picture
Many golfers think they need to hit "down" on the ball, which creates a steep, outside attack. The reality is the club should approach from inside.

## 7 Drills to Fix Over the Top

### 1. Headcover Drill

**Setup:** Place a headcover 6-8 inches behind the ball, just outside your target line.

**Execution:** On the downswing, feel your arms swing *under* the headcover. Your chest should stay "closed" longer as the club drops inside.

**Success check:** If you hit the headcover, you came over the top. Keep practicing until you consistently miss it.

**Why it works:** Creates a visual barrier that forces you to find the inside path.

### 2. Trail Foot Flare

**Setup:** Flare your trail foot (right foot for righties) 15-25 degrees open at address.

**Execution:** Make your normal swing. The flared foot allows your hips to rotate more freely.

**Why it works:** Improved hip rotation creates more depth in your backswing, making it easier to drop the club inside on the downswing.

This is one of the simplest fixes—sometimes a setup change is all you need.

### 3. Hip Bump with Alignment Stick

**Setup:** Place an alignment stick vertically in the ground. Position your front hip about an inch away from it at address.

**Execution:** On the downswing, "bump" your front hip into the stick before your arms swing through.

**Success check:** You should feel your hip touch the stick before the club reaches the ball.

**Why it works:** Forces proper sequencing—lower body leads, arms follow. This creates space for an inside path.

### 4. Ball Throwing Drill

**Setup:** Hold a golf ball in your trail hand (right hand for righties).

**Execution:** Make a backswing motion, then throw the ball *underhand* as if skipping it on water to your right (at 90 degrees from your target line).

**Success check:** If the ball flies straight ahead or left, you're coming over the top. Work until it naturally releases to the right.

**Why it works:** Teaches the feel of proper arm rotation and path without a club.

### 5. Pump Drill

**Setup:** Take your normal address position.

**Execution:** Make a backswing, then "pump" the club down halfway three times without hitting the ball. Feel the club drop into the slot each time. On the fourth pump, complete the swing.

**Why it works:** Builds muscle memory for the correct downswing initiation. The pumping motion reinforces the inside drop.

### 6. Feet Together Drill

**Setup:** Address an 8-iron with your feet completely together.

**Execution:** Make half to three-quarter swings, hitting balls toward a target 75-100 yards away.

**Why it works:** With feet together, you can't throw your body at the ball. Forces proper arm path and timing. If you come over the top with feet together, you'll lose balance immediately.

### 7. Pause at the Top

**Setup:** Normal address position.

**Execution:** Complete your backswing, pause for a full second at the top, then start down *slowly* with your hips before accelerating through impact.

**Why it works:** The pause breaks the habit of rushing from the top with your arms. It gives you time to feel the lower body initiate.

## The Fix in Practice

When working on your over-the-top move:

1. **Start without a ball** — Make dozens of slow practice swings feeling the inside path
2. **Use half swings first** — The shorter swing makes it easier to feel the correct sequence
3. **Record your swing** — [Swing Analyzer](/blog/video-golf-swing-analysis/) can show you exactly where your club path is at each point
4. **One drill at a time** — Pick the drill that gives you the best "feel" and commit to it
5. **Be patient** — This flaw took years to develop; it won't disappear in one range session

## Check Your Divots

Your divot tells the truth. If your divot points left of target (for right-handed golfers), you're still coming over the top. A neutral or slightly right-pointing divot indicates you've found an inside path.

See our guide on [reading divot patterns](/blog/divot-patterns-golf/) for more on this diagnostic tool.

## The Connection to Your Slice

If you slice the ball, over the top is likely the culprit. Check out our detailed guide on [how to fix a golf slice](/blog/fix-golf-slice/) for more drills and fixes specific to eliminating the slice.

The over-the-top move and the slice are closely related, but not identical. You can come over the top and hit pulls (face closed) or slices (face open). Fixing the path is step one; face control is step two.

## Video Analysis Helps

One of the best ways to track your progress is recording your swing from down the line. This angle clearly shows whether your club is dropping inside or thrown outside. [Learn how to record your swing](/blog/how-to-record-golf-swing-phone/) for accurate self-analysis.

Modern apps like Swing Analyzer can trace your club path and show you exactly where the over-the-top move happens, making it easier to target your practice.

## Summary

The over-the-top swing is common but fixable. Key points:

- **It's a sequencing issue** — arms fire before lower body
- **Multiple causes** — identify yours for targeted improvement
- **Drills work** — but commit to one or two rather than trying everything
- **Record your progress** — video doesn't lie
- **Patience required** — ingrained habits take time to change

With consistent practice using these drills, you can eliminate the over-the-top move and start hitting straighter, more powerful shots.
