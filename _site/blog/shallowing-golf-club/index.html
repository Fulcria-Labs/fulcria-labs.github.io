If you’ve watched any YouTube golf content recently, you’ve probably heard instructors yelling “shallow it!” or praising players for a “shallow move.” But what does shallowing actually mean, and why does everyone seem obsessed with it?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-shallowing">What Is Shallowing?</h2>

<p>Shallowing refers to how the club transitions from backswing to downswing. Specifically, it’s when the club drops to a flatter, more horizontal plane at the start of the downswing.</p>

<p>The opposite is “steepening” - when the club moves to a more vertical plane and approaches the ball from an outside path. This is the dreaded “over the top” move.</p>

<p><strong>Visual:</strong> Imagine a clock face behind you. A steep downswing has the club moving from 11 to 5. A shallow downswing moves from 4 to 10.</p>

<h2 id="why-shallowing-helps-your-game">Why Shallowing Helps Your Game</h2>

<h3 id="1-promotes-inside-out-path">1. Promotes Inside-Out Path</h3>

<p>A shallowed club naturally approaches the ball from inside the target line, promoting a draw or straight ball flight rather than a <a href="/golf/swing-tips/2026/01/30/fix-golf-slice.html">slice</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2-uses-ground-force">2. Uses Ground Force</h3>

<p>Shallowing is part of proper sequencing where the lower body leads. This generates power from the ground up rather than relying on arm strength. See our guides on <a href="/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/12/golf-weight-transfer.html">weight transfer</a> and <a href="/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/10/golf-hip-rotation.html">hip rotation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="3-creates-better-contact">3. Creates Better Contact</h3>

<p>With a shallower approach angle, there’s a longer “flat spot” at the bottom of the swing. This gives you more margin for error - you’re not as dependent on perfect timing.</p>

<h3 id="4-matches-what-tour-pros-do">4. Matches What Tour Pros Do</h3>

<p>Nearly every professional golfer shallows in transition. It’s not a stylistic choice - it’s a fundamental of efficient mechanics.</p>

<h2 id="the-over-the-top-problem">The Over-the-Top Problem</h2>

<p>When you don’t shallow (or you steepen), the club comes down outside the intended path. To avoid a massive slice, your body compensates by opening up early, which opens the clubface.</p>

<p>The result is one of two misses:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pull-slice</strong> (starts left, curves right)</li>
  <li><strong>Pull-hook</strong> (starts left, goes more left)</li>
</ul>

<p>Both are inconsistent and lose distance.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-feel-the-shallow-move">How to Feel the Shallow Move</h2>

<h3 id="drill-1-the-headcover-under-arm">Drill 1: The Headcover Under Arm</h3>

<p>Place a headcover under your trail armpit at setup. Make swings keeping it there through impact. This forces your trail elbow to drop down rather than away from your body.</p>

<h3 id="drill-2-pause-at-top">Drill 2: Pause at Top</h3>

<p>Make your backswing, pause for a full second at the top, then start the downswing by feeling like you drop your hands straight down. The arms should feel passive in transition.</p>

<h3 id="drill-3-the-wall-drill">Drill 3: The Wall Drill</h3>

<p>Stand with your rear end against a wall. Make a backswing, then try to start your downswing with your hips moving toward the target while keeping your rear end against the wall. This separates lower body and upper body.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-way-to-check-your-transition">The Best Way to Check Your Transition</h2>

<p>Film your swing from behind (down the line view). Draw a line along your shaft at the top of the backswing. Where does the club go in the first move down?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Above the line</strong> = steepening (over the top)</li>
  <li><strong>On the line</strong> = maintaining (neutral)</li>
  <li><strong>Below the line</strong> = shallowing (good)</li>
</ul>

<p>AI swing analyzers can detect this automatically and show you frame-by-frame where your transition goes wrong.</p>
