    <p>The backswing sets up everything that follows. A good backswing makes the downswing easier. A bad one forces compensations that lead to inconsistent contact.</p>

<p>Here’s how to build a backswing that works.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-backswing-actually-does">What the Backswing Actually Does</h2>

<p>The backswing serves three purposes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Stores energy</strong> through coil between upper and lower body</li>
  <li><strong>Sets the club</strong> in position for a good downswing path</li>
  <li><strong>Creates width</strong> for speed and power</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s not about getting the club “somewhere.” It’s about how you get there.</p>

<h2 id="the-correct-sequence">The Correct Sequence</h2>

<p>Many golfers focus on where the club should be. But the <em>sequence</em> matters more than the positions.</p>

<h3 id="1-the-first-move">1. The First Move</h3>

<p>Everything moves together for the first foot of the takeaway. Club, hands, arms, chest—they’re all connected.</p>

<p>Common mistake: Moving just the hands and arms while the body stays frozen. This creates an early wrist hinge and a narrow, weak position.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-turn-not-the-lift">2. The Turn (Not the Lift)</h3>

<p>Once the club passes your right leg (for right-handed golfers), your shoulders begin to turn. The arms continue moving because they’re connected to the turning torso—not because you’re lifting them independently.</p>

<p>Feel: Your back turning toward the target by the time your hands reach hip height.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-set">3. The Set</h3>

<p>As your shoulders complete their turn, your wrists naturally hinge and the club sets. This should feel gradual, not abrupt.</p>

<p>By the top: Your left arm is relatively straight, wrists are hinged, and the club points roughly at the target (parallel to the target line).</p>

<h2 id="key-positions-to-check">Key Positions to Check</h2>

<h3 id="shoulder-turn">Shoulder Turn</h3>

<p>At the top, your back should face the target (or close to it). This creates the coil that generates power.</p>

<ul>
  <li>90+ degrees of shoulder turn is ideal</li>
  <li>Less rotation limits power potential</li>
  <li>Over-rotation can cause loss of balance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weight-distribution">Weight Distribution</h3>

<p>Your weight should shift into your right hip and right foot—but stay centered, not swaying.</p>

<p>Feel: Pressure into the inside of your right foot, right glute engaged.</p>

<h3 id="arm-position">Arm Position</h3>

<p>Left arm relatively straight (not rigid), right elbow pointing down or slightly behind you.</p>

<p>Avoid: Chicken wing (left arm bending) or flying right elbow (pointing away from body).</p>

<h3 id="club-position">Club Position</h3>

<p>At parallel: The clubface should match your spine angle (not pointing at the sky or the ground).</p>

<p>At the top: Club roughly parallel to target line, face matching lead forearm angle.</p>

<h2 id="common-backswing-mistakes">Common Backswing Mistakes</h2>

<h3 id="1-lifting-instead-of-turning">1. Lifting Instead of Turning</h3>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Arms lift while the body stays static. Results in no coil, narrow arc, and usually an over-the-top downswing.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix</strong>: Practice takeaways with a headcover under your right armpit. If it falls, you’re lifting. If it stays, your arms are connected to your turn.</p>

<h3 id="2-swaying-off-the-ball">2. Swaying Off the Ball</h3>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: The whole body slides right instead of rotating. Difficult to get back to the ball consistently.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix</strong>: Practice against a wall with your right hip touching it. You should feel rotation <em>into</em> the wall, not movement away from it.</p>

<h3 id="3-reverse-pivot">3. Reverse Pivot</h3>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Weight shifts to the left foot on the backswing, then to the right foot on the downswing. Backward from what you want.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix</strong>: Focus on feeling pressure into your right foot at the top. Take practice swings and pause at the top—where’s your weight?</p>

<h3 id="4-too-fast-or-too-slow">4. Too Fast or Too Slow</h3>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Rushing the backswing (jerky) or moving too slowly (no rhythm).</p>

<p><strong>The Fix</strong>: Find a tempo that lets you stay in balance. Many pros use a 3:1 ratio (backswing takes 3x as long as downswing). Count “one-two-three” on the way back, “one” on the way down.</p>

<h3 id="5-cupped-or-bowed-wrist-at-the-top">5. Cupped or Bowed Wrist at the Top</h3>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong>: Excessive cupping opens the face. Excessive bowing closes it. Either requires compensation.</p>

<p><strong>The Fix</strong>: Check your lead wrist at the top. A neutral position (flat wrist, matching forearm angle) is easiest to repeat.</p>

<h2 id="drills-for-better-backswing">Drills for Better Backswing</h2>

<h3 id="mirror-drill">Mirror Drill</h3>

<p>Practice in front of a mirror (or window reflection). Take slow backswings and check:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your shoulder turn complete?</li>
  <li>Is your weight in your right side?</li>
  <li>Is the club in a good position at the top?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pause-at-the-top">Pause at the Top</h3>

<p>Make real swings but pause for a full second at the top before starting down. This builds awareness of where you actually are—not where you think you are.</p>

<h3 id="split-grip-drill">Split Grip Drill</h3>

<p>Separate your hands on the grip by 3-4 inches. This prevents excessive hand and arm action and forces you to turn your body.</p>

<h3 id="one-arm-backswings">One-Arm Backswings</h3>

<p>Take your right hand off the club and make backswings with just your left arm. This teaches connection between arm swing and body turn.</p>

<h2 id="how-ai-analysis-helps">How AI Analysis Helps</h2>

<p>Modern <a href="/2026/02/19/how-ai-analyzes-golf-swing/">swing analyzers</a> can measure your backswing automatically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shoulder rotation degrees</li>
  <li>Hip rotation and X-factor (shoulder-hip differential)</li>
  <li>Hand path and club position</li>
  <li>Weight shift patterns (with pressure mats)</li>
</ul>

<p>This data shows you exactly what’s happening—not what you feel or assume. Many golfers discover their “full turn” is actually 60 degrees, not the 90 they thought.</p>

<p>Seeing real numbers changes behavior faster than feel alone.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaway">The Takeaway</h2>

<p>Your backswing doesn’t need to look like anyone else’s. But it does need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create coil through proper body rotation</li>
  <li>Keep the club on a workable path</li>
  <li>Load your weight into your trail side</li>
  <li>Set you up for a good <a href="/2026/02/27/golf-downswing-sequence/">downswing sequence</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Focus on sequence over positions. Get the order right, and the positions tend to follow.</p>

<p>And if you’re unsure what your backswing actually looks like? <a href="/2026/02/17/phone-golf-swing-video/">Record it</a>. The gap between feel and real is usually bigger than you think.</p>
