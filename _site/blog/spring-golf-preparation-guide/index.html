    <p>The days are getting longer. The snow is melting. And somewhere in the back of your mind, you can feel it: golf season is almost here.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. That first round back after a long winter can be brutal. Your swing feels foreign. Your body doesn’t rotate like you remember. And those three-putts pile up faster than you’d like to admit.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. With the right preparation in the weeks leading up to your first round, you can step onto the course feeling confident instead of rusty.</p>

<p>This guide covers everything you need to get ready for golf season: rust-busting drills, flexibility work, equipment checks, and mental preparation. Let’s make this your best start to a golf season yet.</p>

<h2 id="why-spring-preparation-matters">Why Spring Preparation Matters</h2>

<p>Your golf swing is a complex movement pattern. When you don’t use it for months, those patterns fade. Your brain literally forgets some of the neural pathways that made your swing work.</p>

<p>Add to that the physical changes from a sedentary winter. Tighter hips. Stiffer shoulders. Reduced core flexibility. These limitations force compensations in your swing that lead to inconsistent contact and unwanted ball flights.</p>

<p>The good news? A few weeks of intentional preparation can reverse most of this. You can walk into spring feeling like you never put the clubs down.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-rust-busting-drills">Part 1: Rust-Busting Drills</h2>

<p>Before you head to the range and start pounding driver, you need to rebuild the foundation. These drills work whether you’re hitting balls or practicing at home.</p>

<h3 id="the-100-swings-a-day-method">The 100 Swings a Day Method</h3>

<p>Legendary instructor Hank Haney swears by this simple approach. You don’t need a golf ball or even much space. Just you and a club.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Start with 25 swings at 50% speed and effort</li>
  <li>Progress to 25 swings at 75% speed</li>
  <li>Finish with 50 swings at full speed</li>
</ol>

<p>Do this daily for two weeks before your first real range session. You’re reawakening the muscle memory and rebuilding range of motion simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Without a ball to worry about, you focus purely on the movement. Your body remembers the pattern without the pressure of producing a result.</p>

<h3 id="feet-together-drill">Feet Together Drill</h3>

<p>This drill exposes balance and sequencing issues that creep in over the winter.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Set up with your feet touching or nearly touching</li>
  <li>Use a mid-iron (7 or 8)</li>
  <li>Make half swings, focusing on staying balanced</li>
  <li>Gradually increase swing length as balance improves</li>
</ol>

<p>If you fall over or lose your footing, your sequence is off. This drill forces efficiency because you can’t muscle it with poor mechanics. It also helps rebuild your <a href="/2026/01/16/golf-swing-tempo/">tempo</a> naturally.</p>

<h3 id="the-towel-chip-drill">The Towel Chip Drill</h3>

<p>Your short game is where strokes disappear most quickly after time off. This drill rebuilds touch and distance control.</p>

<p><strong>How to do it:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Lay a towel flat on the ground 10-15 feet away</li>
  <li>Hit chip shots, trying to land the ball on the towel</li>
  <li>Move the towel to different distances</li>
  <li>Track your success rate</li>
</ol>

<p>Start with easy chips before progressing to longer pitches. The feedback is immediate, and the target focus rebuilds your feel quickly.</p>

<h3 id="mirror-slow-motion-work">Mirror Slow-Motion Work</h3>

<p>You can do this one at home with no equipment needed. Stand in front of a mirror or reflective window and make slow-motion swings.</p>

<p><strong>Check these positions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/2026/01/17/golf-setup-stance/">Setup and posture</a> at address</li>
  <li>Shoulder turn at the top of your <a href="/2026/01/22/golf-backswing/">backswing</a></li>
  <li>Hip rotation through impact</li>
  <li>Balance at finish</li>
</ul>

<p>Slow motion reveals flaws that full-speed swings hide. Spend 5 minutes daily on mirror work and you’ll be surprised how much it helps.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-flexibility-exercises-for-golfers">Part 2: Flexibility Exercises for Golfers</h2>

<p>Winter makes us stiff. And stiff bodies can’t make full turns. A limited turn means less power and often leads to compensations that cause slices, hooks, and inconsistent contact.</p>

<p>Here are the key areas to focus on and exercises to improve each.</p>

<h3 id="hip-flexibility">Hip Flexibility</h3>

<p>Your hips initiate the downswing and generate most of your power. Tight hips = short, powerless swings.</p>

<p><strong>90/90 Hip Stretch:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sit on the floor with one leg bent in front (90 degrees) and one leg bent behind (90 degrees)</li>
  <li>Keep your torso upright</li>
  <li>Hold for 30 seconds, then switch sides</li>
  <li>Repeat 3 times per side</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Hip Circles:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Stand on one leg (hold something for balance)</li>
  <li>Circle your free leg forward, out, back, and around</li>
  <li>Do 10 circles each direction, both legs</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="shoulder-and-upper-back-mobility">Shoulder and Upper Back Mobility</h3>

<p>A full shoulder turn requires mobility through your thoracic spine and shoulders. Most desk workers are tight here.</p>

<p><strong>Thread the Needle:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Start on hands and knees</li>
  <li>Reach your right arm under your body, rotating your upper back</li>
  <li>Follow with your eyes as your arm reaches through</li>
  <li>Return and repeat 10 times per side</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Doorway Chest Stretch:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Stand in a doorway with your arm against the frame at 90 degrees</li>
  <li>Step forward gently until you feel a stretch in your chest and front shoulder</li>
  <li>Hold 30 seconds per side</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="core-rotation">Core Rotation</h3>

<p>Your core transfers power from lower body to upper body. Limited rotation here limits everything.</p>

<p><strong>Seated Trunk Rotation:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sit on the floor with legs extended</li>
  <li>Cross your arms over your chest</li>
  <li>Rotate your upper body as far as you can to the right, then left</li>
  <li>Do 20 total rotations slowly and controlled</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Standing Golf Rotations:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Hold a club across your shoulders</li>
  <li>Get into your golf posture</li>
  <li>Rotate into your backswing position and hold 2 seconds</li>
  <li>Rotate through to your follow-through position and hold 2 seconds</li>
  <li>Repeat 20 times</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="daily-flexibility-routine">Daily Flexibility Routine</h3>

<p>Commit to 10 minutes of flexibility work each morning for the four weeks leading up to golf season. Here’s a simple routine:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Exercise</th>
      <th>Duration</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Hip circles</td>
      <td>1 minute</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>90/90 stretch</td>
      <td>2 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Thread the needle</td>
      <td>2 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Doorway chest stretch</td>
      <td>2 minutes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Standing golf rotations</td>
      <td>3 minutes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>That’s it. Ten minutes a day will make a dramatic difference in how your body moves when you finally swing a club again.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-equipment-check">Part 3: Equipment Check</h2>

<p>Your body isn’t the only thing that needs attention after the off-season. Your equipment matters too.</p>

<h3 id="grip-inspection">Grip Inspection</h3>

<p>Grips wear out slowly, so you don’t notice until they’re really bad. Pick up each club and feel the grip.</p>

<p><strong>Signs you need new grips:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Shiny, slick spots</li>
  <li>Cracks or hardening</li>
  <li>Loss of tackiness even when dry</li>
  <li>Visible wear patterns</li>
</ul>

<p>Worn grips cause you to hold the club tighter, which creates tension that kills your swing. Regripping costs $5-10 per club and makes a noticeable difference.</p>

<h3 id="club-cleaning">Club Cleaning</h3>

<p>Dirty grooves don’t spin the ball properly. Give your irons and wedges a proper cleaning:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fill a bucket with warm, soapy water</li>
  <li>Let the clubheads soak for 5 minutes</li>
  <li>Scrub the grooves with a brush</li>
  <li>Dry thoroughly</li>
</ol>

<p>Clean clubs perform like they’re supposed to. Dirty clubs make inconsistent contact even worse.</p>

<h3 id="ball-and-accessory-inventory">Ball and Accessory Inventory</h3>

<p>Check your golf balls. Old balls in the garage that have been through freeze-thaw cycles may have lost compression. Start fresh with a new dozen.</p>

<p>Also review:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gloves (replace if worn or stiff)</li>
  <li>Tees (stock up)</li>
  <li>Ball markers and divot tools</li>
  <li>Umbrella and rain gear</li>
  <li>Sunscreen and bug spray</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing derails an early-season round like realizing you’re missing something essential.</p>

<h3 id="bag-organization">Bag Organization</h3>

<p>Take everything out of your bag. Clean out the old scorecards, broken tees, and mystery snacks. Reorganize so you know where everything is.</p>

<p>While you’re at it, consider whether your bag setup makes sense. Can you easily reach your most-used clubs? Is there a better arrangement?</p>

<h2 id="part-4-mental-preparation">Part 4: Mental Preparation</h2>

<p>Your mind needs warming up just like your body. The mental game often suffers most during time off because we forget how to manage our thoughts on the course.</p>

<h3 id="reset-your-expectations">Reset Your Expectations</h3>

<p>Here’s the truth: your first few rounds will not be your best golf. Accept this now.</p>

<p>The goal for early-season rounds isn’t to shoot your career best. It’s to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rebuild feel and touch</li>
  <li>Identify what needs work</li>
  <li>Enjoy being back outside playing golf</li>
</ul>

<p>When you remove the pressure of score expectations, you actually play better because you’re relaxed.</p>

<h3 id="visualization-practice">Visualization Practice</h3>

<p>Spend time before the season visualizing successful shots. This isn’t woo-woo nonsense. It’s proven sports psychology.</p>

<p><strong>How to visualize effectively:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Close your eyes and relax</li>
  <li>Picture yourself on a specific hole you know well</li>
  <li>See the shot you want to hit in vivid detail: the flight, the landing, the roll</li>
  <li>Feel the swing that produces that shot</li>
  <li>Repeat with different scenarios</li>
</ol>

<p>Do this for 5 minutes a few times per week. When you get to the course, those shots will feel familiar even though you haven’t hit them in months.</p>

<h3 id="rebuild-your-pre-shot-routine">Rebuild Your Pre-Shot Routine</h3>

<p>Your <a href="/2026/01/09/golf-practice-routine/">pre-shot routine</a> is your mental anchor. It’s the consistent ritual that puts you in the right headspace before every shot.</p>

<p>During your early practice sessions, don’t just work on swing mechanics. Practice your full routine:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stand behind the ball and pick your target</li>
  <li>Visualize the shot</li>
  <li>Walk into your setup</li>
  <li>One practice swing</li>
  <li>Execute</li>
</ol>

<p>The routine is what makes golf feel normal again. Rebuilding it early means it’s automatic when you’re on the course.</p>

<h3 id="managing-first-tee-nerves">Managing First-Tee Nerves</h3>

<p>That first round back is exciting. And for many golfers, excitement translates to nervousness. Here’s how to handle it:</p>

<p><strong>Before the round:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Arrive early so you’re not rushed</li>
  <li>Hit balls starting with wedges, not driver</li>
  <li>Putt for at least 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Do some flexibility stretches</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>On the first tee:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Take one extra breath before you swing</li>
  <li>Pick a specific target, not just “the fairway”</li>
  <li>Swing at 80%, not 100%</li>
  <li>Accept whatever happens and move on</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is survival on the first few holes. Once you settle in, your real game shows up.</p>

<h2 id="your-spring-golf-prep-timeline">Your Spring Golf Prep Timeline</h2>

<p>Here’s a suggested schedule for the six weeks before your first round:</p>

<h3 id="weeks-6-5-foundation-phase">Weeks 6-5: Foundation Phase</h3>
<ul>
  <li>100 swings daily (no ball)</li>
  <li>10 minutes flexibility routine</li>
  <li>Equipment inspection and cleaning</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weeks-4-3-skill-rebuilding-phase">Weeks 4-3: Skill Rebuilding Phase</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Range sessions (start short, build up)</li>
  <li>Mirror work at home</li>
  <li>Putting practice</li>
  <li>Continue flexibility work</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weeks-2-1-integration-phase">Weeks 2-1: Integration Phase</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Full practice sessions</li>
  <li>Short game focus</li>
  <li>Play 9 holes if possible</li>
  <li>Visualization sessions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="opening-week">Opening Week</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Light practice (don’t overdo it)</li>
  <li>Course management review</li>
  <li>Final equipment check</li>
  <li>Enjoy your first round</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-video-analysis-in-your-prep">Using Video Analysis in Your Prep</h2>

<p>One of the best things you can do during spring prep is record your swing. The gap between how your swing feels and how it actually looks is usually bigger than you think, especially after months off.</p>

<p><a href="/2026/01/20/phone-golf-swing-video/">Recording your swing with just your phone</a> is easy. You don’t need fancy equipment or a tripod. Just prop your phone up and hit a few balls.</p>

<p>What you’re looking for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is your setup where it should be?</li>
  <li>Does your backswing look like it used to?</li>
  <li>Where is the club at impact?</li>
  <li>Do you have good balance at the finish?</li>
</ul>

<p>This baseline recording tells you what actually needs work versus what you assume needs work.</p>

<h2 id="start-your-season-right">Start Your Season Right</h2>

<p>Spring golf preparation isn’t about becoming a different golfer. It’s about reclaiming the golfer you already are. Your swing is still in there somewhere. Your short game touch is dormant, not dead. Your mental game just needs a reminder.</p>

<p>Put in the work during the pre-season, and you’ll be rewarded with a smoother, more confident start to your golf year. Skip the prep, and you’ll spend your first month fighting rust instead of enjoying the game.</p>

<p>The choice is yours. But if you’re reading this, you probably already know which path leads to better golf.</p>
