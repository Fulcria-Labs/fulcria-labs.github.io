    <p>The difference between a 90-shooter and a scratch golfer often isn’t their swing mechanics—it’s what happens in the 30 seconds before they swing.</p>

<p>A solid pre-shot routine is like mental autopilot. It keeps you calm, clear, and confident on every shot. Without one, you’re leaving your performance to chance.</p>

<h2 id="why-pre-shot-routines-work">Why Pre-Shot Routines Work</h2>

<p>When you go through the same sequence before every shot, something powerful happens:</p>

<p><strong>Your brain shifts gears.</strong> Research shows that consistent routines help athletes enter a “ready state” where distractions fade and focus sharpens.</p>

<p><strong>Doubt disappears.</strong> Making decisions <em>before</em> you step to the ball means no second-guessing over it.</p>

<p><strong>Bad shots don’t compound.</strong> A routine gives you a reset button—no matter what happened on the last shot.</p>

<p>The best players in the world all have pre-shot routines. They’re not superstitious rituals. They’re performance systems.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-phases-of-every-pre-shot-routine">The Two Phases of Every Pre-Shot Routine</h2>

<h3 id="phase-1-planning-behind-the-ball">Phase 1: Planning (Behind the Ball)</h3>

<p>This is where the real work happens—and where most amateurs skip critical steps.</p>

<p><strong>1. Assess the Situation</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What’s the lie? Uphill, downhill, sidehill?</li>
  <li>Where’s the danger? Water, OB, bunkers?</li>
  <li>What’s the wind doing?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Pick Your Target</strong>
Not “the fairway” or “the green.” A <em>specific</em> target—a tree, a bunker edge, a section of the green. Vague targets produce vague shots.</p>

<p><strong>3. Choose Your Shot Shape</strong>
Commit to a specific ball flight. Draw, fade, or straight. High or low. If you’re not sure, pick one and trust it. Indecision is worse than a suboptimal choice.</p>

<p><strong>4. Select Your Club</strong>
Factor in wind, lie, and your typical miss. When in doubt, take more club. Most amateurs miss short.</p>

<p><strong>5. Visualize the Shot</strong>
Picture the ball flight from takeoff to landing. See it in your mind’s eye. This isn’t woo-woo—visualization primes your motor system for execution.</p>

<h3 id="phase-2-execution-over-the-ball">Phase 2: Execution (Over the Ball)</h3>

<p>Once you’ve made your decisions, it’s time to <em>stop thinking and start doing</em>.</p>

<p><strong>1. Pick an Intermediate Target</strong>
Choose something 2-3 feet in front of your ball on your target line—a leaf, a divot, a discolored patch of grass. Use it to align your clubface.</p>

<p><strong>2. Take Your Setup</strong>
Step in from the same side every time. Set your feet, align your body, get comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>3. Look at the Target</strong>
Take one or two looks at where you want the ball to go. Feel the distance.</p>

<p><strong>4. Go</strong>
Don’t linger. Start your swing within 2-3 seconds of your final look. The longer you stand there, the more doubt creeps in.</p>

<h2 id="the-align-look-go-method">The “Align, Look, Go” Method</h2>

<p>If you want a simple trigger, try this: <strong>Align, Look, Go.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Align:</strong> Set your feet and clubface to your intermediate target</li>
  <li><strong>Look:</strong> One final glance at your target</li>
  <li><strong>Go:</strong> Pull the trigger—no hesitation</li>
</ul>

<p>This three-word mantra keeps you from overthinking at the worst possible moment.</p>

<h2 id="why-most-routines-fail">Why Most Routines Fail</h2>

<h3 id="problem-1-skipping-the-planning-phase">Problem 1: Skipping the Planning Phase</h3>

<p>Golfers who rush to the ball without assessing the shot make poor decisions under pressure. You can’t commit to a shot you haven’t decided on.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Do your thinking behind the ball. Once you step in, the only job is execution.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-taking-too-long-over-the-ball">Problem 2: Taking Too Long Over the Ball</h3>

<p>Stand over the ball for 10+ seconds and watch what happens: tension builds, doubts creep in, and you make a tense, protective swing.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Keep the execution phase short—ideally under 8 seconds from address to impact. Time yourself to find out.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-changing-the-routine-under-pressure">Problem 3: Changing the Routine Under Pressure</h3>

<p>Your routine should be identical whether you’re on the practice range or standing over a 4-footer to break 80. Changing it signals to your brain that “this one matters more,” which creates tension.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Practice your full routine on the range. Make it automatic.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-build-your-routine">How to Build Your Routine</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-study-the-pros">Step 1: Study the Pros</h3>

<p>Watch players you admire in slow motion. Notice their rhythms, their triggers, their timing. Rory takes practice swings behind the ball. Scottie Scheffler does his waggle. Find elements that resonate with you.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-create-your-sequence">Step 2: Create Your Sequence</h3>

<p>Write down every step, from behind the ball to impact. Be specific:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stand behind ball, assess lie and target</li>
  <li>Visualize ball flight</li>
  <li>Pick club</li>
  <li>Walk to ball from left side</li>
  <li>Set clubface to intermediate target</li>
  <li>Set feet</li>
  <li>One waggle</li>
  <li>Look at target twice</li>
  <li>Swing</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-3-practice-it-every-shot">Step 3: Practice It Every Shot</h3>

<p>On the range, use your full routine for <em>every</em> ball. Not just the ones that matter—all of them. Treat each like it’s the last shot of a tournament.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-time-it">Step 4: Time It</h3>

<p>Your routine should take the same amount of time every shot. Use a stopwatch on the range. Once you know your natural timing, you’ll notice when pressure is making you rush or drag.</p>

<h2 id="drills-for-building-a-rock-solid-routine">Drills for Building a Rock-Solid Routine</h2>

<h3 id="the-commit-drill">The “Commit” Drill</h3>

<p>Before every shot, say out loud (or in your head): “I’m hitting a [fade/draw/straight] to [specific target].”</p>

<p>If you can’t complete the sentence with confidence, step back and restart your routine. No shot is worth taking if you’re not committed.</p>

<h3 id="the-reset-drill">The Reset Drill</h3>

<p>After a bad shot, physically step away from the ball location. Take a breath. Walk back to where you’d start your routine. Begin fresh.</p>

<p>This builds the habit of resetting rather than carrying frustration into the next shot.</p>

<h3 id="the-pressure-simulation">The Pressure Simulation</h3>

<p>On the range, play a mental game: “This shot is for birdie to win the match.” Go through your full routine. Feel the pressure. Then execute.</p>

<p>The more you practice routine-under-pressure in low-stakes settings, the more automatic it becomes when the pressure is real.</p>

<h2 id="the-mental-hack-trust-over-technique">The Mental Hack: Trust Over Technique</h2>

<p>Here’s the paradox of the pre-shot routine: the more you trust it, the less you think.</p>

<p>Your planning phase is where analysis happens. Your execution phase is where trust lives. The routine is the bridge between them.</p>

<p>Once you step to the ball, your job is simple: aim and fire. All the thinking is done. All that’s left is letting your body do what it knows how to do.</p>

<h2 id="using-technology-to-reinforce-your-routine">Using Technology to Reinforce Your Routine</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to improve your pre-shot routine is to watch yourself execute it. <a href="/2026/01/17/phone-golf-swing-recording/">Recording your swing on your phone</a> captures more than just mechanics—it shows your setup rhythm and timing.</p>

<p>When you review your swings, notice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How long do you stand over the ball?</li>
  <li>Do you rush when you’re nervous?</li>
  <li>Are you looking at your target enough?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://swing.fulcria.com">Swing Analyzer</a> gives you instant feedback on your setup position and <a href="/2026/01/23/golf-alignment-and-aim/">alignment</a>, helping you see whether your routine is producing consistent starting positions.</p>

<h2 id="your-one-takeaway">Your One Takeaway</h2>

<p><strong>A great pre-shot routine isn’t about rituals—it’s about confidence.</strong></p>

<p>Every step in your routine should serve one purpose: putting you in a state where doubt can’t exist. Planning happens first. Then you commit. Then you execute without hesitation.</p>

<p>Build your routine. Practice it until it’s automatic. Then trust it when it matters.</p>

<p>That’s how you bring your range game to the course.</p>
