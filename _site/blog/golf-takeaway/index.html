    <p>The takeaway is the first 12-18 inches of your golf swing—and according to top instructors, it’s the number one issue they see in beginning golfers. Get it wrong, and you’re fighting your swing the rest of the way. Get it right, and everything else becomes easier.</p>

<h2 id="why-the-takeaway-matters-so-much">Why the Takeaway Matters So Much</h2>

<p>Think of the takeaway like the first domino in a chain. If that first domino falls in the wrong direction, everything that follows will be off.</p>

<p>A faulty takeaway leads to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Casting the club from the top</li>
  <li>Coming over the top</li>
  <li>Poor contact and inconsistent ball striking</li>
  <li>Loss of power</li>
  <li>The dreaded slice or hook</li>
</ul>

<p>A proper takeaway sets up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On-plane backswing</li>
  <li>Proper wrist hinge</li>
  <li>Full shoulder turn</li>
  <li>Stored power for the downswing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-correct-golf-takeaway">The Correct Golf Takeaway</h2>

<h3 id="what-should-move-first">What Should Move First?</h3>

<p>The takeaway should be a one-piece motion where your hands, arms, and shoulders move together. There’s no independent hand action in the first foot of the swing.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Everything moves together</strong> - Imagine your hands, arms, and chest are connected as one unit</li>
  <li><strong>Club stays outside the hands</strong> - At the first checkpoint (hands at hip height), the club should point at or slightly outside the target line</li>
  <li><strong>Triangle maintains</strong> - The triangle formed by your arms and shoulders at address should stay intact</li>
  <li><strong>No wrist hinge yet</strong> - The wrists stay quiet until the hands pass hip height</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-first-checkpoint">The First Checkpoint</h3>

<p>When your hands reach hip height:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Club shaft should be roughly parallel to the ground</li>
  <li>Clubhead should be outside your hands (not behind you)</li>
  <li>Your left arm (for right-handed golfers) should still be relatively straight</li>
  <li>Weight should feel centered or slightly loaded into your right heel</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="common-takeaway-mistakes">Common Takeaway Mistakes</h2>

<h3 id="1-picking-the-club-up">1. Picking the Club Up</h3>

<p>The most common beginner error is using the hands and arms to lift the club straight up. This creates a steep, narrow swing that leads to poor contact.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Feel like you’re pushing the club away from you in the first foot. The clubhead should move back before it moves up.</p>

<h3 id="2-taking-it-too-inside">2. Taking It Too Inside</h3>

<p>When the club whips quickly to the inside, it gets behind you and typically leads to coming over the top in the downswing—the classic slice pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Focus on the clubhead staying outside your hands. A helpful image is pushing the club toward the right side of the range (for right-handed golfers).</p>

<h3 id="3-opening-the-clubface">3. Opening the Clubface</h3>

<p>Some golfers roll their forearms open in the takeaway, fanning the clubface open. This requires compensation to square the face at impact.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Keep the clubface pointing at the ball or slightly toward the ground in the first foot of the swing. Don’t let it look at the sky.</p>

<h3 id="4-starting-with-the-hands">4. Starting With the Hands</h3>

<p>Leading with the hands alone, without the body connection, creates a handsy, inconsistent swing.</p>

<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Feel your left shoulder (for right-handers) start the motion, pushing across your chin as the swing begins.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaway-drill">The Takeaway Drill</h2>

<p>Here’s a simple drill you can practice at home or on the range:</p>

<p><strong>The Headcover Drill:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Place a headcover or glove about 18 inches behind the ball, directly on your target line</li>
  <li>Practice taking the club back so the clubhead passes over the headcover</li>
  <li>If you’re taking it too inside, you’ll hit the headcover</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Low and Slow Drill:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Without a ball, practice taking the club back extremely slowly</li>
  <li>Stop when your hands reach hip height</li>
  <li>Check: Is the shaft parallel? Is the clubhead outside your hands?</li>
  <li>Repeat 10 times, gradually increasing speed</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-it-connects-to-your-backswing">How It Connects to Your Backswing</h2>

<p>A proper takeaway flows directly into a proper <a href="/blog/golf-backswing/">backswing</a>. When the first move is correct:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your shoulders will turn fully</li>
  <li>Your club will stay on plane</li>
  <li>You’ll maintain proper width</li>
  <li>The transition to the downswing becomes natural</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-video-analysis-helps">How Video Analysis Helps</h2>

<p>The takeaway happens quickly—in less than a second. That’s why it’s so hard to feel what you’re actually doing versus what you think you’re doing.</p>

<p>Recording your swing lets you freeze the moment when your hands reach hip height. You can check:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the shaft parallel to the ground?</li>
  <li>Is the clubhead outside your hands or behind you?</li>
  <li>Are your arms and shoulders moving together?</li>
  <li>Has your weight started loading into your trail side?</li>
</ul>

<p>Try <a href="https://swing.fulcria.com">Swing Analyzer</a> to see your takeaway in slow motion. The AI will identify if you’re starting inside or picking the club up—two of the most common issues that golfers can’t feel but are easy to see on video.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The takeaway is the #1 issue</strong> instructors see in beginners</li>
  <li><strong>Move everything together</strong> - hands, arms, and shoulders as one unit</li>
  <li><strong>Keep it low and wide</strong> - push the club back before it goes up</li>
  <li><strong>Check at hip height</strong> - shaft parallel, clubhead outside hands</li>
  <li><strong>Record yourself</strong> - you can’t feel what you can’t see</li>
</ol>

<p>Master the first foot of your swing, and the rest becomes dramatically easier. It’s the foundation everything else is built on.</p>
