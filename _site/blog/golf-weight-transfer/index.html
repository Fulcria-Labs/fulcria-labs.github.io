<p>Weight transfer is arguably the most fundamental element of the golf swing. Without it, you’re swinging with just arms. With it, you’re using the ground to generate power like the pros. Yet most amateur golfers either ignore it or do it wrong.</p>

<h2 id="what-weight-transfer-looks-like">What Weight Transfer Looks Like</h2>

<p>At address, your weight should be roughly 50/50 between your feet, maybe slightly favoring the trail foot.</p>

<p>In the backswing, weight shifts to your trail side—you should feel pressure in your trail hip and foot. About 60-70% of your weight ends up on the trail side at the top.</p>

<p>In the transition and downswing, weight shifts aggressively toward the target. At impact, 80% or more of your weight should be on your front foot.</p>

<p>In the follow-through, you end with nearly all your weight on your front foot, able to lift your trail foot off the ground and hold your finish in balance.</p>

<h2 id="why-weight-transfer-matters">Why Weight Transfer Matters</h2>

<p><strong>For power:</strong> Ground reaction force is how you tap into the biggest energy source available. Pushing off the ground generates force that travels up through your body and into the club.</p>

<p><strong>For contact:</strong> Your low point (where the club touches the ground) follows your weight. If your weight stays back, your low point moves back—leading to fat and thin shots. This is why weight transfer is essential for <a href="/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/09/golf-ball-compression.html">proper ball compression</a>.</p>

<p><strong>For consistency:</strong> A predictable weight shift creates a predictable swing path. Erratic weight means erratic contact.</p>

<h2 id="the-most-common-problem-reverse-pivot">The Most Common Problem: Reverse Pivot</h2>

<p>A reverse pivot is when you do the opposite of what you should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backswing: Weight moves toward target (instead of trail side)</li>
  <li>Downswing: Weight moves away from target (instead of toward it)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is extremely common among beginners and often develops from trying to “keep your head still” or “stay behind the ball.”</p>

<p>How to spot it: If you finish on your back foot or fall backward, you’re probably reverse pivoting.</p>

<h2 id="drills-to-improve-weight-transfer">Drills to Improve Weight Transfer</h2>

<h3 id="drill-1-step-drill">Drill 1: Step Drill</h3>

<p>Take your normal backswing, but lift your front foot completely off the ground. At the start of your downswing, step toward the target and plant your front foot before you strike the ball. This exaggerates the weight shift feeling.</p>

<h3 id="drill-2-water-bottle-drill">Drill 2: Water Bottle Drill</h3>

<p>Place a water bottle just outside your trail heel. Make swings without knocking it over. This trains you to shift forward without sliding.</p>

<h3 id="drill-3-push-the-ground">Drill 3: Push the Ground</h3>

<p>Focus on the feel of pushing off your trail foot as you start down. It should feel like you’re jumping off that foot. The ground is your launchpad.</p>

<h3 id="drill-4-swing-to-your-finish">Drill 4: Swing to Your Finish</h3>

<p>Instead of thinking about the ball, think about your finish position. Swing through to where you’re balanced on your front foot, chest facing the target. If you swing to a good finish, weight transfer tends to take care of itself.</p>

<h2 id="feel-vs-real">Feel vs. Real</h2>

<p>One important note: what weight transfer feels like and what it actually is are often different. Many golfers who feel like they’re shifting aggressively are actually still hanging back.</p>

<p>Video doesn’t lie. Record your swing from behind and watch your head position. Does it drift toward the target in the downswing? It should—slightly. If it stays perfectly still or moves backward, you’re not transferring enough.</p>

<h2 id="weight-transfer-and-hip-rotation">Weight Transfer and Hip Rotation</h2>

<p>These two concepts are linked. Good <a href="/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/10/golf-hip-rotation.html">hip rotation</a> naturally creates good weight transfer. If your hips rotate toward the target, your weight follows. If your hips stall or spin out, your weight gets stuck.</p>

<p>Work on both together for best results.</p>

<h2 id="the-feel-youre-looking-for">The Feel You’re Looking For</h2>

<p>At impact, you should feel like you’re “hitting off your front side.” Your front leg should be firm (not locked, but stable). You should feel pressure through your front foot into the ground.</p>

<p>Think of throwing a ball or punching—you don’t do either with your weight on your back foot.</p>
