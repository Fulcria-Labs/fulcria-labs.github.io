<p>If you’ve taken any golf lesson in the past decade, you’ve probably heard about hip rotation. “Clear your hips.” “Fire your hips.” “Turn through.” But what does it actually mean, and why do so many golfers get it wrong?</p>

<h2 id="what-your-hips-should-do">What Your Hips Should Do</h2>

<p>In a well-sequenced swing:</p>

<p><strong>Backswing:</strong> Your hips rotate 40-45 degrees away from the target. This creates tension between your upper and lower body—the “X-factor” that generates power.</p>

<p><strong>Transition:</strong> Your hips start moving toward the target before your arms finish going back. This creates a separation that builds even more stored energy.</p>

<p><strong>Downswing:</strong> Your hips rotate aggressively toward the target, pulling the upper body and arms along. At impact, your belt buckle should be pointing left of target (for righties).</p>

<p><strong>Follow-through:</strong> Full hip rotation with your weight on your front foot. You should be able to hold this position in balance.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-most-common-mistakes">The Two Most Common Mistakes</h2>

<h3 id="mistake-1-sliding-instead-of-rotating">Mistake 1: Sliding Instead of Rotating</h3>

<p>Many golfers slide their hips toward the target instead of rotating. This kills power and causes inconsistent contact.</p>

<p>How to spot it: If your head moves significantly toward the target in the downswing, you’re probably sliding. Your hips should turn in place, not shift laterally.</p>

<h3 id="mistake-2-early-hip-rotation">Mistake 2: Early Hip Rotation</h3>

<p>Some golfers spin out too early—the hips fly open before the arms can catch up. This creates an over-the-top move and pulls the club across the ball. For more on this, see our <a href="/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/04/shallowing-golf-club.html">shallowing the club guide</a>.</p>

<p>How to spot it: If you consistently hit pulls or pull-slices, your hips might be outpacing your arms.</p>

<h2 id="three-drills-to-improve-hip-rotation">Three Drills to Improve Hip Rotation</h2>

<h3 id="drill-1-the-alignment-stick-check">Drill 1: The Alignment Stick Check</h3>

<p>Stick an alignment rod through your belt loops. Make practice swings watching where it points throughout the swing. In the backswing, it should point right of target. At impact, it should point left of target.</p>

<h3 id="drill-2-the-wall-drill">Drill 2: The Wall Drill</h3>

<p>Stand with your rear end lightly touching a wall. Make slow-motion swings, focusing on keeping your rear end against the wall while your hips rotate. This teaches rotation without slide.</p>

<h3 id="drill-3-flare-your-trail-foot">Drill 3: Flare Your Trail Foot</h3>

<p>Many golfers restrict hip turn because their feet are square. Try flaring your trail foot 20-25 degrees open. This unlocks your hip joint and allows a fuller turn.</p>

<h2 id="hip-mobility-matters">Hip Mobility Matters</h2>

<p>Here’s the hard truth: some golfers physically can’t rotate their hips properly because of limited mobility. Tight hip flexors, weak glutes, or general inflexibility create a ceiling on your swing.</p>

<p>Before blaming technique, check your mobility. Can you turn your hips 45 degrees comfortably? If not, stretching and mobility work will help your game more than any swing tip.</p>

<h2 id="the-connection-to-ball-compression">The Connection to Ball Compression</h2>

<p>Remember that <a href="/golf/swing-tips/2026/02/09/golf-ball-compression.html">ball compression</a> requires forward weight shift and a descending blow. Proper hip rotation is what creates that. When your hips lead the downswing and rotate through impact, your weight naturally moves forward and the club approaches from the inside on a downward path.</p>

<p>Without hip rotation, you’re swinging with just arms—and that’s a recipe for weak, inconsistent contact.</p>

<h2 id="tempo-and-hip-timing">Tempo and Hip Timing</h2>

<p>The hips need to lead, but not too early. Think of a 3-count rhythm:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Backswing (hips turn away)</li>
  <li>Transition (hips bump and start toward target)</li>
  <li>Impact (hips rotated 40+ degrees open)</li>
</ol>

<p>If your hips get to position 3 before your arms get to position 2, you’re out of sync.</p>

<p>An AI swing analyzer can detect hip rotation angles and timing automatically. It’s one of the most telling metrics for swing efficiency.</p>
