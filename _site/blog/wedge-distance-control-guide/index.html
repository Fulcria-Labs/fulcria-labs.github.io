    <p>Inside 100 yards, distance control separates the golfers who scramble for par from those who convert birdie opportunities. Yet most amateurs treat their wedges like full-swing clubs, hoping for the best rather than knowing exactly where the ball will land.</p>

<p>Tour pros typically carry three to four wedges and know precise distances for multiple swing lengths with each one. You don’t need their talent to build similar precision—you need a system and deliberate practice.</p>

<h2 id="why-distance-control-matters-more-than-direction">Why Distance Control Matters More Than Direction</h2>

<p>Here’s a counterintuitive truth: from 80 yards, your dispersion pattern is likely wider front-to-back than side-to-side. A ball landing 15 feet left of the pin but at the right depth leaves a makeable putt. A ball that’s perfectly on line but 30 feet long or short creates a three-putt scenario.</p>

<p>Distance control is the scoring game.</p>

<h2 id="three-systems-for-wedge-distance-control">Three Systems for Wedge Distance Control</h2>

<h3 id="1-the-clock-method">1. The Clock Method</h3>

<p>The most structured approach uses swing length as your primary distance variable. Imagine your arms as clock hands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>9 o’clock</strong>: Hands at hip height (roughly half swing)</li>
  <li><strong>10:30</strong>: Hands at shoulder height (three-quarter swing)</li>
  <li><strong>Full swing</strong>: Complete backswing</li>
</ul>

<p>For each wedge, these positions produce consistent yardages. Example for a 56-degree sand wedge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>9 o’clock: 50 yards</li>
  <li>10:30: 70 yards</li>
  <li>Full: 90 yards</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Highly repeatable, easy to reference under pressure
<strong>Cons</strong>: Requires disciplined practice to calibrate, can feel mechanical</p>

<h3 id="2-the-feel-based-system">2. The Feel-Based System</h3>

<p>Some players struggle with fixed positions. The feel-based approach uses tempo rather than swing length to control distance.</p>

<p>Think of it like a volume dial:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Soft</strong>: Slower tempo, abbreviated follow-through</li>
  <li><strong>Medium</strong>: Normal pace</li>
  <li><strong>Full</strong>: Maximum clubhead speed</li>
</ul>

<p>This system requires more practice reps to develop reliable feel, but many players find it more natural once established. A metronome app during practice can help calibrate your tempo settings.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-three-swing-approach">3. The Three-Swing Approach</h3>

<p>The simplest system: learn exactly three distances per wedge:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Half swing</li>
  <li>Three-quarter swing</li>
  <li>Full swing</li>
</ul>

<p>With four wedges, that gives you 12 precise yardages. Fill gaps by choking up on the club (typically reduces distance 5-8 yards per inch).</p>

<h2 id="the-foundation-consistent-contact">The Foundation: Consistent Contact</h2>

<p>No system works without solid contact. Heel and toe strikes transfer different amounts of energy even with identical swings.</p>

<p><strong>The Spray Test</strong>: During practice, spray foot powder on your clubface. After 10-15 shots, the wear pattern reveals your strike consistency. Center-face contact should be your first priority.</p>

<p><strong>Setup Fundamentals for Solid Contact</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ball position: Slightly back of center</li>
  <li>Hands: Slightly forward of the ball at address</li>
  <li>Weight: 60/40 favoring your lead leg</li>
  <li>Grip pressure: Light (3-4 out of 10)</li>
</ul>

<p>That forward press and weight distribution pre-sets a descending blow. You’re hitting down through the ball, not scooping up at it.</p>

<h2 id="phil-mickelsons-key-insight">Phil Mickelson’s Key Insight</h2>

<p>“I see so many instructors teach this clock method where you want to go back and through the same distance… that’s crazy! You want to accelerate into the ball.”</p>

<p>The common amateur mistake: huge backswing, deceleration through impact. The fix: shorter backswing, accelerate through to a fuller finish.</p>

<p>Deceleration destroys distance control. It also produces fat shots, thin shots, and chunks. When in doubt, take one more club and make an accelerating pass.</p>

<h2 id="five-practice-drills-that-build-real-skill">Five Practice Drills That Build Real Skill</h2>

<h3 id="1-the-ladder-drill">1. The Ladder Drill</h3>

<p>Set three zones with alignment sticks or tees:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zone 1: 30 yards</li>
  <li>Zone 2: 50 yards</li>
  <li>Zone 3: 70 yards</li>
</ul>

<p>Start by landing two consecutive shots in Zone 1. Then Zone 2. Then Zone 3. Miss? Start over from Zone 1.</p>

<p>Advanced version: Hit Zone 1, then 2, then 3, then 2, then 1 in sequence without missing.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-3-foot-circle-challenge">2. The 3-Foot Circle Challenge</h3>

<p>Pick a flag on the practice green. Hit wedge shots from various distances, trying to land every ball within 3 feet of the hole.</p>

<p>Track your percentage. Tour pros land approximately 70% of their 50-yard shots inside 10 feet. Your goal: consistent improvement, not perfection.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-cone-distance-drill">3. The Cone Distance Drill</h3>

<p>Place targets at 10-yard intervals: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 yards. With one wedge, work through each distance, noting how the swing feels different at each. Then switch wedges and repeat.</p>

<p>This drill builds the mental yardage chart that becomes automatic on the course.</p>

<h3 id="4-the-tempo-matching-drill">4. The Tempo Matching Drill</h3>

<p>Hit three balls to each distance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First ball: Normal tempo</li>
  <li>Second ball: Slightly slower tempo</li>
  <li>Third ball: Slightly faster tempo</li>
</ul>

<p>Note which tempo produces the most consistent distance for you. Many players are surprised to find slower tempo equals better results.</p>

<h3 id="5-the-grip-down-challenge">5. The Grip-Down Challenge</h3>

<p>From 70 yards, hit five balls with normal grip. Then five with hands one inch down. Then five with hands two inches down.</p>

<p>Track landing spots. You’re building a secondary distance control tool—grip position—that works without changing swing length.</p>

<h2 id="building-your-personal-yardage-chart">Building Your Personal Yardage Chart</h2>

<p>Spend one range session (30-40 balls per wedge) mapping your distances:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Wedge</th>
      <th>Grip Down 2”</th>
      <th>Grip Down 1”</th>
      <th>Normal</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>PW</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>GW</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SW</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LW</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
      <td>___</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Do this for each swing length (half, three-quarter, full). A launch monitor helps, but landing spots on a measured range work too.</p>

<p>Transfer these numbers to a card in your bag. Reference it until the numbers become automatic.</p>

<h2 id="common-mistakes-to-avoid">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p><strong>Mistake 1: Hitting every wedge full</strong>
Solution: Practice partial shots more than full shots. Tour pros rarely hit full wedges.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 2: Changing swing for every yardage</strong>
Solution: Build a system (clock, feel, or three-swing) and stick with it.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 3: Ignoring lie and wind</strong>
Solution: Factor conditions into club selection, not swing mechanics. Tight lie? Take one more club. Into wind? Same.</p>

<p><strong>Mistake 4: Death grip</strong>
Solution: Lighter grip pressure equals better feel. Tension kills touch.</p>

<h2 id="from-practice-to-course">From Practice to Course</h2>

<p>The driving range is a controlled environment. The course adds pressure, uneven lies, wind, and consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-shot routine for wedges</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get exact yardage (laser or GPS)</li>
  <li>Assess lie, wind, pin position</li>
  <li>Select club and swing length</li>
  <li>Visualize landing spot (not the hole)</li>
  <li>Execute with commitment</li>
</ol>

<p>Step 4 matters most. Pick a specific landing spot and commit to hitting it. The ball’s job is to roll out from there to the hole.</p>

<h2 id="how-video-analysis-helps">How Video Analysis Helps</h2>

<p>Wedge distance inconsistency often stems from subtle swing changes you can’t feel. Common culprits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backswing length varying shot to shot</li>
  <li>Weight shift timing</li>
  <li>Wrist hinge differences</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/best-way-record-golf-swing-phone/">Recording your practice sessions</a> and reviewing them reveals patterns invisible in real-time. You might think you’re making consistent 9 o’clock swings while actually varying from 8 to 10.</p>

<p>Modern swing analyzers can track these variables automatically, showing trends across multiple shots rather than single-swing snapshots.</p>

<h2 id="the-mental-side">The Mental Side</h2>

<p>Under pressure, most golfers tense up and swing harder. This destroys wedge distance control.</p>

<p>Commit to your system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Know your yardage</li>
  <li>Select your swing length</li>
  <li>Trust the process</li>
</ul>

<p>Doubt creates deceleration. Confidence creates acceleration. Practice builds confidence.</p>

<h2 id="your-practice-plan">Your Practice Plan</h2>

<p>Week 1-2: Establish baseline distances with full swings for each wedge.</p>

<p>Week 3-4: Add three-quarter and half swings. Map the yardages.</p>

<p>Week 5-6: Practice the ladder drill and target drills until you can predict landing spots within 5 yards.</p>

<p>Ongoing: Spend 30% of short game practice on distance control, 30% on contact quality, 40% on putting. Most amateurs over-practice full swings and under-practice scoring shots.</p>

<hr />

<p>Wedge distance control is learnable. It requires a system, deliberate practice, and patience. The payoff—consistent proximity to the hole from scoring range—transforms your ability to make birdies and save pars.</p>

<p>Start with one wedge, one distance. Build from there. Your handicap will thank you.</p>
