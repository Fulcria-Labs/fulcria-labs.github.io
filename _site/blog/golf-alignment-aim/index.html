    <p>You’ve grooved a good swing, picked the perfect club, and visualized the shot. Then you pull it 30 yards left. What happened? Probably nothing wrong with your swing—you were just aimed there.</p>

<p><strong>Poor alignment is the hidden thief of good golf.</strong> Studies show amateur golfers routinely aim 20-40 yards off target without realizing it. Your brain compensates with swing adjustments that create inconsistency.</p>

<p>Let’s fix it with a simple, repeatable alignment routine.</p>

<h2 id="the-fundamental-mistake">The Fundamental Mistake</h2>

<p>Here’s what most golfers get wrong: <strong>they aim their body directly at the target.</strong></p>

<p>Wrong approach. Your <strong>clubface</strong> aims at the target. Your <strong>body</strong> aligns parallel-left of the target (for right-handers). Think railroad tracks—the clubface travels on the outer rail to the target, while your feet, hips, and shoulders run parallel on the inner rail.</p>

<p>When you point your body at the target, you’re actually aimed right of where you want to go. Then you manipulate the swing to pull it back, creating a mess of compensations.</p>

<h2 id="the-intermediate-target-technique">The Intermediate Target Technique</h2>

<p>Here’s the secret the pros use: <strong>don’t aim at your target—aim at a spot a few inches in front of your ball.</strong></p>

<p>Why? It’s nearly impossible to accurately aim at something 200 yards away. But you can easily aim at a spot 6-8 inches in front of you.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-pick-your-intermediate-target">How to pick your intermediate target:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Stand behind your ball looking at your target</li>
  <li>Draw an imaginary line from target through your ball</li>
  <li>Find a spot on that line 6-8 inches in front of your ball (divot, discolored grass, leaf)</li>
  <li>Use that spot to aim your clubface</li>
</ol>

<p>This simple change dramatically improves aim accuracy. Some instructors even recommend picking spots both in front of AND behind the ball for even better alignment.</p>

<h2 id="the-complete-alignment-routine">The Complete Alignment Routine</h2>

<p>Build this routine into every shot:</p>

<h3 id="step-1-pick-a-precise-target">Step 1: Pick a Precise Target</h3>
<p>Don’t aim at “the fairway” or “the green.” Pick something specific—the top of a tree, a flagstick, a specific yardage marker. The more precise your target, the more accurate your aim.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-find-your-intermediate-target">Step 2: Find Your Intermediate Target</h3>
<p>From behind the ball, identify a spot 6-8 inches in front of your ball on the target line.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-clubface-first">Step 3: Clubface First</h3>
<p>Walk into your setup and place the clubface behind the ball, aiming at your intermediate target. The bottom groove should point directly at that spot.</p>

<p><strong>This is the most important part—clubface position dictates starting direction.</strong></p>

<h3 id="step-4-build-your-stance">Step 4: Build Your Stance</h3>
<p>Now build your stance around the clubface:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place your back foot perpendicular to the target line</li>
  <li>Place your front foot parallel</li>
  <li>Keep your feet, knees, hips, and shoulders all parallel to the target line</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-5-one-last-look">Step 5: One Last Look</h3>
<p>Take one final glance at your target—not at your intermediate spot, at your actual target. Then trust your setup and swing.</p>

<h2 id="the-pointing-trick">The Pointing Trick</h2>

<p>Top instructor Ryan Young recommends a visual calibration technique: <strong>extend your lead arm and point at your target.</strong></p>

<p>Before you swing, reach out with your front arm and actually point at where you want the ball to go. This recalibrates both your vision and your swing path. It’s especially useful on the tee when you’re tempted to aim at the middle of the fairway instead of your actual target.</p>

<h2 id="the-shoulder-alignment-trap">The Shoulder Alignment Trap</h2>

<p>Here’s where most alignment problems actually start: <strong>your shoulders.</strong></p>

<p>Instructor Devan Bonebrake finds that students lose their shoulder alignment more than any other body part. You might have your feet perfect, but if your shoulders are open or closed, your swing will follow your shoulders—not your feet.</p>

<h3 id="the-shoulder-check">The shoulder check:</h3>
<p>Hold a club across your chest with arms crossed. Look down at where it points. It should run parallel to your target line—not at the target, and not left or right of it.</p>

<h2 id="practice-your-alignment">Practice Your Alignment</h2>

<p>On the range:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Use alignment sticks.</strong> Place one stick on the target line, one along your toe line. They should be parallel.</li>
  <li><strong>Drop a club.</strong> Every few balls, lay a club across your toes to check alignment. You’ll be surprised how quickly it drifts.</li>
  <li><strong>Have someone stand behind you.</strong> They can see your actual aim much better than you can.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the course:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can legally use your club to check alignment (lay it across your toes) <strong>before</strong> you take your stance</li>
  <li>Use the intermediate target technique on every shot</li>
  <li>When you miss, first ask “where was I aimed?” before changing your swing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-video-analysis-helps">How Video Analysis Helps</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to see your actual alignment is <strong>video from behind.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://swing.fulcria.com">Swing Analyzer</a> can show you your setup position from multiple angles, making alignment issues immediately visible. What feels straight to you might look 10 degrees open or closed on camera.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-fix">The Real Fix</h2>

<p>Most swing problems aren’t swing problems—they’re aim problems. Before you change your grip, swing plane, or equipment, verify your alignment.</p>

<p>Use the intermediate target technique on every shot. Check your shoulder alignment. Have someone film you from behind. You might find that the swing you’ve been fighting is actually perfectly fine—you were just pointed in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Good alignment won’t fix a broken swing, but bad alignment will break a good one.</p>
