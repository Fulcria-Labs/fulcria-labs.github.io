    <p>“Keep your head still!” It’s the most common advice in golf. And it’s also one of the most misunderstood.</p>

<p>Jack Nicklaus called head position “the most important thing” in the golf swing. But here’s what most golfers get wrong: your head doesn’t need to stay perfectly frozen. In fact, trying to keep it completely still can actually hurt your swing.</p>

<p>Let’s break down what really happens—and what you should actually focus on.</p>

<h2 id="the-myth-of-the-motionless-head">The Myth of the Motionless Head</h2>

<p>Watch any professional golfer in slow motion. Their head moves. Every single one.</p>

<p>The difference? Their movement is controlled, predictable, and serves the swing—not fight against it.</p>

<p>When you try to lock your head in place:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your shoulders can’t rotate fully</li>
  <li>Your weight transfer gets restricted</li>
  <li>You create tension that kills swing speed</li>
  <li>You often end up swaying instead of rotating</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal isn’t zero movement. It’s the <em>right</em> movement at the <em>right</em> time.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-head-movement-good-vs-bad">Types of Head Movement (Good vs. Bad)</h2>

<h3 id="lateral-movement-side-to-side">Lateral Movement (Side to Side)</h3>

<p><strong>Acceptable:</strong> A small shift (1-2 inches) away from the target during the backswing is normal and even helpful. This happens naturally as you load into your trail leg.</p>

<p><strong>Problematic:</strong> Excessive lateral sliding makes it nearly impossible to get back to a consistent impact position. If your head moves 4+ inches off the ball, you’re creating a timing nightmare.</p>

<h3 id="vertical-movement-up-and-down">Vertical Movement (Up and Down)</h3>

<p><strong>Acceptable:</strong> A slight dip in the downswing as you push off the ground for power. This is part of using ground force effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Problematic:</strong> Major dipping or lifting changes your posture mid-swing, leading to <a href="/2026/01/23/stop-fat-thin-shots/">fat and thin shots</a>. Your swing bottoms out in different spots, making consistent contact impossible.</p>

<h3 id="rotational-movement-turning">Rotational Movement (Turning)</h3>

<p><strong>Acceptable:</strong> Your head can rotate slightly with your shoulders. Many top players let their head swivel a bit through impact.</p>

<p><strong>Problematic:</strong> Lifting or twisting your head to “see” the shot too early pulls your shoulders open and creates an <a href="/2026/01/05/fix-golf-slice/">over-the-top move</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-pros-actually-do">What the Pros Actually Do</h2>

<p>Here’s the pattern you’ll see in elite swings:</p>

<p><strong>At Address:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Head centered over the ball</li>
  <li>Chin up slightly to allow shoulder turn</li>
  <li>Eyes focused on the ball</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the Top:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Head may shift 1-2 inches behind the ball</li>
  <li>Head stays level (no major dip or rise)</li>
  <li>Eyes still on the ball position</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Head has returned to roughly its starting position</li>
  <li>Head stays behind the ball (crucial for irons)</li>
  <li>May begin rotating toward target</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Through to Finish:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Head releases naturally to follow the ball</li>
  <li>Chin rotates toward target</li>
  <li>No forced “head down” position</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-real-problem-areas">The Real Problem Areas</h2>

<p>When golfers struggle with head movement, it usually traces back to these root causes:</p>

<h3 id="1-swaying-instead-of-rotating">1. Swaying Instead of Rotating</h3>
<p>If your lower body slides instead of rotates, your head slides with it. Fix the hip turn, and the head often fixes itself.</p>

<h3 id="2-poor-posture-at-setup">2. Poor Posture at Setup</h3>
<p>If you’re hunched over or too upright, you’ll fight your posture throughout the swing. Get your <a href="/2026/01/17/golf-setup-stance/">setup fundamentals</a> right first.</p>

<h3 id="3-looking-up-too-early">3. Looking Up Too Early</h3>
<p>The urge to see where the ball goes is powerful. But lifting your head early opens your shoulders and kills solid contact. The ball will still be there when you look up a half-second later.</p>

<h3 id="4-overactive-upper-body">4. Overactive Upper Body</h3>
<p>When your arms and shoulders dominate the <a href="/2026/01/25/golf-downswing-sequence/">downswing</a> instead of your lower body, your head gets pulled forward. Focus on the <a href="/2026/01/25/golf-downswing-sequence/">proper downswing sequence</a> to keep everything in sync.</p>

<h2 id="drills-to-improve-head-position">Drills to Improve Head Position</h2>

<h3 id="the-shadow-drill">The Shadow Drill</h3>
<p>On a sunny day, set up so your head’s shadow falls on a specific spot. Make practice swings while keeping the shadow relatively still. This gives you instant feedback without the tension of trying to hit a ball.</p>

<h3 id="the-wall-drill">The Wall Drill</h3>
<p>Set up with your head gently touching a wall (or a door frame). Make slow backswings while maintaining light contact with the wall. You’ll immediately feel when you’re moving too much.</p>

<h3 id="the-training-aid-approach">The Training Aid Approach</h3>
<p>Place a headcover or small pillow between your chin and chest at address. Keep it there through the backswing. This trains the connection between your upper body rotation and head position.</p>

<h3 id="partner-feedback">Partner Feedback</h3>
<p>Have a friend hold their finger just above your head at setup. Make swings and get feedback on whether you’re dipping or lifting. External feedback accelerates learning.</p>

<h2 id="how-video-analysis-helps">How Video Analysis Helps</h2>

<p>This is exactly where <a href="/2026/01/12/video-golf-swing/">video swing analysis</a> shines. It’s nearly impossible to feel what your head is doing while swinging at speed. But on video, the truth is obvious.</p>

<p>When reviewing your swing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Draw a line at your head position at address</li>
  <li>Track how much it moves at the top of the backswing</li>
  <li>Check if it returns to roughly the same spot at impact</li>
  <li>Look for any dramatic dipping or lifting</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/2026/01/21/how-ai-analyzes-golf-swing/">AI-powered swing analyzers</a> can track this automatically, comparing your head movement patterns to optimal benchmarks and highlighting when something’s off.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-thing-to-remember">The One Thing to Remember</h2>

<p>Here’s the simplest way to think about it:</p>

<p><strong>Your head should be a passenger in the swing, not the driver.</strong></p>

<p>It moves because your body is rotating and loading. It doesn’t move independently or excessively. When your rotation is good, your weight shift is good, and your sequencing is good—your head takes care of itself.</p>

<p>Focus on the fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Good <a href="/2026/01/17/golf-setup-stance/">setup and posture</a></li>
  <li>Full shoulder turn on the backswing</li>
  <li>Lower body leads the downswing</li>
  <li>Let your head release naturally after impact</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop trying to freeze your head. Start building a swing where proper movement happens automatically.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="track-your-progress">Track Your Progress</h2>

<p>The best way to improve your head position is to see what’s actually happening. <a href="/2026/01/20/phone-golf-swing-video/">Record your swing from face-on</a> and review it in slow motion.</p>

<p>Better yet, use a swing analyzer that tracks your key positions automatically. You’ll see exactly how much your head moves—and whether it’s helping or hurting your contact.</p>
