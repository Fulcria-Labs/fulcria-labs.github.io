    <p>Your wrists are the last link in the power chain before the club. Get the hinge right, and you unlock distance you didn’t know you had. Get it wrong, and you’re leaving shots on the table no matter how hard you swing.</p>

<p>The good news? Wrist hinge isn’t complicated. It’s just widely misunderstood.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-wrist-hinge-in-golf">What Is Wrist Hinge in Golf?</h2>

<p>Wrist hinge (also called wrist cock) is the upward bending of your wrists during the backswing. This motion creates an angle between your lead arm and the club shaft, typically reaching about 90 degrees at the top of a full swing.</p>

<p>Here’s the key insight: wrist hinge moves in a vertical plane, up toward the sky. It’s not a rotational motion around your body. Think of swinging a hammer or throwing a ball underhand. Your wrists hinge up and down naturally. Golf works the same way.</p>

<p>This vertical hinge creates leverage. And leverage is how you generate clubhead speed without muscling the ball.</p>

<h2 id="why-proper-wrist-hinge-matters">Why Proper Wrist Hinge Matters</h2>

<p>Two critical benefits make wrist hinge essential:</p>

<h3 id="1-power-storage">1. Power Storage</h3>

<p>When you hinge your wrists correctly, you store energy that releases through impact. This stored angle is what instructors call “lag.” Without the hinge, there’s nothing to store, and swing speed drops significantly.</p>

<p>Tour players maintain their wrist angle deep into the downswing, releasing it only at the last moment. That delayed release creates the whip effect that sends the ball flying. It’s why they hit it 50 yards farther than most amateurs without looking like they’re swinging harder.</p>

<h3 id="2-ball-contact-quality">2. Ball Contact Quality</h3>

<p>Proper wrist hinge ensures the clubhead descends into the ball correctly. When you maintain the angle and release it at the right moment, your hands arrive ahead of the clubhead at impact. The shaft leans forward. You compress the ball.</p>

<p>Without wrist hinge, the club tends to scoop at the ball. Contact becomes inconsistent. Fat shots, thin shots, and that weak, high ball flight that goes nowhere become the norm.</p>

<h2 id="when-should-you-hinge-your-wrists">When Should You Hinge Your Wrists?</h2>

<p>This is where most golfers get confused. There are two schools of thought, and both can work.</p>

<h3 id="early-hinge-traditional-method">Early Hinge (Traditional Method)</h3>

<p>In this approach, your wrists begin hinging as soon as the club passes your right thigh. By the time your hands reach hip height in the <a href="/2026/01/22/golf-backswing/">backswing</a>, your wrists are already set.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Creates a consistent, repeatable position. Removes one timing element from the swing.</p>

<p><strong>Best for</strong>: Beginners, golfers who struggle with timing, players who tend to get “handsy” at the top.</p>

<h3 id="gradual-hinge-modern-method">Gradual Hinge (Modern Method)</h3>

<p>Here, the wrists hinge progressively throughout the backswing, completing only near the top. The takeaway stays “one-piece” with arms and club moving together.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Maintains width longer for a bigger arc. Creates more of a connected, body-driven swing.</p>

<p><strong>Best for</strong>: Athletic players, those with good flexibility, golfers who tend to lift rather than turn.</p>

<h3 id="which-one-should-you-choose">Which One Should You Choose?</h3>

<p>Honestly, either can work. What matters more is that you reach a properly hinged position at the top, not exactly when you get there. If you’re inconsistent, try the early hinge. It removes variables. If you’re athletic and seeking maximum power, the gradual hinge might suit you better.</p>

<h2 id="the-checkpoint-that-matters-most">The Checkpoint That Matters Most</h2>

<p>Forget about hinge timing for a moment. Here’s the position you need to achieve:</p>

<p><strong>At the top of your backswing</strong>, with your lead arm roughly parallel to the ground, there should be approximately a 90-degree angle between your lead arm and the club shaft. The club should point roughly at the target (parallel to your target line).</p>

<p>This is your loaded position. This is where the power lives.</p>

<p>If you reach this position, it doesn’t matter much whether you hinged early or late. But if you never get here, you’re starting the downswing at a disadvantage.</p>

<h2 id="common-wrist-hinge-mistakes">Common Wrist Hinge Mistakes</h2>

<h3 id="1-not-hinging-enough">1. Not Hinging Enough</h3>

<p>Some golfers, often told to keep their swing “simple” or “quiet,” barely hinge at all. Their arms and club move as a rigid unit. Result: no leverage, weak shots, and frustration despite “good fundamentals.”</p>

<p><strong>The fix</strong>: Feel like you’re cocking the club straight up as your shoulders turn. It should feel like a lot. Video usually reveals it’s just enough.</p>

<h3 id="2-hinging-too-much-and-too-abruptly">2. Hinging Too Much (and Too Abruptly)</h3>

<p>The opposite extreme. These golfers break their wrists immediately in the takeaway, creating a steep, narrow backswing. The club points at the sky before the hands even reach hip height.</p>

<p><strong>The fix</strong>: Keep the club low and wide in the first part of the takeaway. Feel like your hands, arms, and club move together for the first couple feet. Let the hinge happen gradually as your shoulders turn.</p>

<h3 id="3-wrong-hinge-direction">3. Wrong Hinge Direction</h3>

<p>This one’s sneaky. Instead of hinging vertically (up toward the sky), some golfers hinge horizontally, fanning the club around their body. The wrists rotate instead of cock.</p>

<p><strong>The fix</strong>: At hip height in the backswing, the butt of the club should point at or near your target line. If it points way right, you’ve rolled it open. Practice the vertical “hammer swing” feeling.</p>

<h3 id="4-cupping-the-lead-wrist">4. Cupping the Lead Wrist</h3>

<p>When your lead wrist cups excessively (bends backward) as you hinge, the clubface opens. Now you spend the rest of the swing trying to close it. Hello, slice.</p>

<p><strong>The fix</strong>: Focus on keeping your lead wrist flat or even slightly bowed as you hinge. The feeling might be that the clubface points more at the ground, but video usually shows it’s just square. This is essential for proper <a href="/2026/01/26/club-face-control/">club face control</a>.</p>

<h3 id="5-losing-the-hinge-too-early-casting">5. Losing the Hinge Too Early (Casting)</h3>

<p>You can hinge perfectly in the backswing and still throw it away immediately on the downswing. This is <a href="/2026/01/30/stop-casting-golf-club/">casting</a>, and it’s devastating to your power.</p>

<p><strong>The fix</strong>: The hinge you create in the backswing needs to be preserved into the downswing. Focus on starting down with your lower body while your wrists stay quiet. The release happens naturally near the ball, not at the top.</p>

<h2 id="4-drills-to-master-your-wrist-hinge">4 Drills to Master Your Wrist Hinge</h2>

<h3 id="1-the-l-drill">1. The L-Drill</h3>

<p>Stand in front of a mirror with a club. Take the club back to hip height only. Stop and check: does your lead arm and club form an “L” shape? The club should point up at roughly 90 degrees.</p>

<p>Do this 20 times slowly, checking the position each time. You’re building awareness of what proper hinge actually feels like.</p>

<h3 id="2-the-one-arm-drill">2. The One-Arm Drill</h3>

<p>Hold the club in just your lead hand (left for right-handed golfers). Make slow backswings and feel how naturally your wrist wants to hinge. There’s no trail hand to manipulate or over-control. Just a natural, vertical hinge.</p>

<p>Do this for 10-15 reps, then add your trail hand and try to recreate the same feeling.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-preset-drill">3. The Preset Drill</h3>

<p>Before starting your swing, preset your wrist hinge. Cock your wrists so the club points at the sky, then turn your shoulders while maintaining that angle.</p>

<p>This exaggerates early wrist set, but it teaches the feeling of a properly hinged position throughout the backswing. Use it as a warm-up before rounds or practice sessions.</p>

<h3 id="4-the-hammer-drill">4. The Hammer Drill</h3>

<p>Hold the club like a hammer, with just your lead hand gripping near the head. Pretend you’re hammering a nail into a wall in front of you at waist height.</p>

<p>Notice how your wrist hinges vertically, up and down. That’s the motion you want in your golf swing. The hammer metaphor clicks for most golfers because it’s such a natural wrist movement.</p>

<h2 id="how-wrist-hinge-connects-to-lag">How Wrist Hinge Connects to Lag</h2>

<p>Wrist hinge and <a href="/2026/01/30/creating-lag-golf-swing/">lag</a> are intimately connected. Here’s the relationship:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Backswing</strong>: You create wrist hinge (the angle)</li>
  <li><strong>Transition</strong>: You preserve that angle (this creates lag)</li>
  <li><strong>Downswing</strong>: You maintain it as long as possible</li>
  <li><strong>Impact</strong>: You <a href="/2026/01/27/golf-release/">release</a> the angle into the ball</li>
</ul>

<p>Lag is simply the retention of the wrist angle you set in the backswing. If you don’t hinge properly, there’s nothing to retain. If you don’t retain it, there’s nothing to release. Both pieces matter.</p>

<p>The kinetic chain depends on proper sequencing. Your <a href="/2026/01/25/golf-downswing-sequence/">downswing sequence</a> starts from the ground up, allowing the wrist angle to be preserved naturally. When you start down with your arms, the angle releases immediately, and lag evaporates.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-look-for-in-video">What to Look for in Video</h2>

<p>Record your swing from a down-the-line angle. Check these frames:</p>

<p><strong>Frame 1: Hands at hip height (backswing)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Is there an angle forming between your arm and club?</li>
  <li>Is the club hinging upward, not rolling around your body?</li>
  <li>Is the clubface relatively square (matching your spine angle)?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Frame 2: Top of backswing</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Is there approximately 90 degrees between your lead arm and shaft?</li>
  <li>Is your lead wrist flat or slightly bowed (not cupped)?</li>
  <li>Does the club point roughly at the target?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Frame 3: Hands at hip height (downswing)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Is the wrist angle still present? (This is the lag check)</li>
  <li>Or has it already released? (Casting)</li>
</ul>

<p>Compare your swing to these checkpoints. The gap between what you feel and what’s real is often significant.</p>

<h2 id="quick-practice-session-for-wrist-hinge">Quick Practice Session for Wrist Hinge</h2>

<p>Here’s a 15-minute drill session you can do at the range or even at home:</p>

<p><strong>Warm-up (3 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>10 slow swings with just your lead hand</li>
  <li>Focus on natural, vertical hinge</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>L-Drill (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>20 reps to hip height, checking the L position</li>
  <li>Add 10 full backswings, pausing at the top to feel the hinge</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hit Balls (5 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>10 half-swing shots, focusing only on hinge</li>
  <li>Let the results take care of themselves</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Integration (2 minutes)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>5 full swings at 70% speed</li>
  <li>Try to feel that properly hinged position carry into your normal swing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Wrist hinge isn’t optional. It’s how you create the leverage that generates power without effort. The angle you set in the backswing becomes the lag you preserve in the downswing and the speed you release through impact.</p>

<p>Don’t overthink the timing. Whether you set early or gradually matters less than reaching a properly hinged position at the top. From there, focus on sequencing your downswing correctly, and the release takes care of itself.</p>

<p>Get this right, and shots that felt impossible start feeling automatic.</p>
